## Overview

W55RP20-EVB-Pico is an evaluation board for W55RP20, a chip that combines W5500, a wired TCP/IP controller, and RP2040.
Therefore, both the functions of Raspberry Pi Pico and those of the W5500 are available.

- Raspberry Pi Pico Clone
- Ethernet (W55RP20 Hardwired TCP/IP CHIP)

## Hardware Specification

### Pin-out

![W55RP20-EVB-PICO](/img/products/w55rp20-evb-pico/w55rp20-evb-pico-pinout.png)

W55RP20-EVB-Pico pinout is directly connected to the GPIO of RP2040 as shown in the above picture. It has the same pinout as the Raspberry Pi Pico board. However, GPIO17, GPIO20, GPIO21, GPIO22, GPIO23, GPIO24, and GPIO25 are not available due to the connection inside the board.

The W55RP20 GPIO used inside W55RP20-EVB-Pico is as follows.

| I/O  | Pin Name | Description                                    |
| :--: | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
|  O   | GPIO16   | DCDC Mode Select Pin                           |
|  I   | GPIO18   | VBUS sense - high if VBUS is present, else low |
|  O   | GPIO19   | Connected to user LED                          |
|  I   | GPIO29   | Used in ADC mode (ADC3) to measure VSYS/3      |


Apart from GPIO and ground pins, there are 7 other pins on the main 40-pin interface:

| Pin No. | Pin Name | Description                                                  |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PIN40   | VBUS     | Micro-USB input voltage, connected to micro-USB port pin 1. Nominally 5V. |
| PIN39   | VSYS     | Main system input voltage, which can vary in the allowed range 4.3V to 5.5V, and is used by the on-board LDO to generate the 3.3V . |
| PIN37   | 3V3_EN   | Connects to the on-board LDO enable pin. To disable the 3.3V (which also de-powers the RP2040 and W5500), short this pin low. |
| PIN36   | 3V3      | Main 3.3V supply to RP2040  and W5500, generated by the on-board LDO. |
| PIN35   | ADC_VREF | ADC power supply (and reference) voltage, and is generated on W5500-EVB-Pico by filtering the 3.3V supply. |
| PIN33   | AGND     | Ground reference for GPIO26-29.                              |
| PIN30   | RUN      | RP2040 enable pin, To reset RP2040, short this pin low.      |

### Operation Condition

| Item                      | Description                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Operation Temperature MAX | 85C (including self-heating) |
| Operation Temperature MIN | -45C                         |
| VBUS                      | DC 5V (+/- 10%)              |
| VSYS Min                  | DC 4.3V                      |
| VSYS Max                  | DC 5.5V                      |

Recommended maximum ambient temperature of operation is 70C.
