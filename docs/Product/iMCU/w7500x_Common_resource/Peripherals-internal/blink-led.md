### Example Description

GPIO ports are connected on APB2 bus, using UB_MASKED and LB_MASKED registers 
2 cycles are required to set a pin and another cycle to reset it. So GPIO pins
can toggle at AHB clock divided by 4.

This example describes how to use UB_MASKED and LB_MASKED
(Port Bit GPIO_SetBits/GPIO_ResetBits Register)

PC_05, PC_08, PC_09(configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever 
loop:
 - Set Pin_5 and Pin_8 and Pin_9 by setting corresponding bits 
   in GPIO_SetBits register.
 - Reset Pin_5 and Pin_8 and Pin_9 by setting corresponding bits 
   in GPIO_ResetBits register.
