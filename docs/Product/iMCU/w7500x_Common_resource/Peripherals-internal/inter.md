### Example Description

This example provides a basic communication between Uart0 and Uart1 using 
interrupts.
Uart1 sends TxBuffer2 to Uart0 which sends TxBuffer1 to Uart1. The data received 
by Uart0 and Uart1 are stored respectively in RxBuffer1 and RxBuffer2. The data
transfer is managed in Uart0_IRQHandler and Uart1_IRQHandler in W7500x_it.c file

The UART0/UART1 is configured as follow:

  - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disable
  - Receive and transmit enable
    
This example describes that the data send from UART0 to UART1.
