## System architecture

Main system consists of:

  * Ethernet:
    * IP101G
  * Two masters:
    * Cortex-M0 core
    * uDMAC(PL230, 6 channels)
  * Ten slaves
    * Internal BOOT ROM
    * Internal SRAM
    * Internal Flash Memory
    * Two AHB2APB bridge which connects all APB peripherals
    * Four AHB dedicated to 16-bit GPIOs
    * TCP/IP Hardware core

AHB-Lite BUS

- This bus connects the two masters (Cortex-M0 and uDMAC) and ten AHB slaves.

Two APB BUSs

- These buses connect Seventeen APB peripherals (Watchdog, two dual timers, pwm, two UARTs, simple UART<!--,two I2Cs-->, two SSPs, random number generator, real time clock, 12bits analog digital converter, clock controller, IO configuration, PAD MUX controller)


## Memory organization

Program memory, data memory, registers and I/O ports are organized within the same linear 4-Gbyte address space.
The bytes are coded in memory in Little Endian format. The lowest numbered byte in a word is considered the wordâ€™s least significant byte and the highest numbered byte the most significant.


### Memory map

## System Configuration Controller (SYSCFG)

Main purposes of the system configuration controller are the following

  * Control of the memory remap feature
  * The ability to enable an automatic reset if the system locks up
  * Information about the cause of the last reset
