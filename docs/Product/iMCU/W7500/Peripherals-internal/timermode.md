### Example Description 

This example shows how to use the PWM peripheral to run time mode.

The PWM channel 0 frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz), the Prescaler is 2 
so the PWM0 counter clock is 10 MHz.
SystemCoreClock is set to 20 MHz.

The PWM channel 0 is configured in Timer Mode and duty cycle is 50 %.
Timer/Counter is up-count mode and periodic mode. 2 interrupts out of 3 interrupts
are enabled: match and overflow interupt(capture interrupt is excepted).

When the Timer/Counter reaches the match value, RED LED(PC_08) is toggled every times, 
and when the Tiemr/Counter reaches the limit value, GREEN LED(PC_09) is toggled every times.

### Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with WIZnet WIZwiki W7500 platform.
  - To select the WIZnet WIZwiki platform used to run the example.
  
  - WIZwiki W7500 Set-up
    - Use RED LED connected to PC_08 pin.
    - Use GREEN LED connected to PC_09 pin.
    - In order to use the RED LED(PC_08) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF1.
    - In order to use the GREEN LED(PC_09) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF1.
  
### How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - WIZwiki W7500 where the Flash memory density ranges 128Kbytes.
 - If you have any questions, please use the forum site.
