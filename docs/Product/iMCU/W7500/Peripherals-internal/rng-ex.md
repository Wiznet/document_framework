### Example Description

This example shows how to use RNG of W7500.

In this example:
  - 1) Read power on initial random number
  - 2) Read manual random number
  - 3) Change Seed value & polynomial and read manual random number

### Flow Chart 

 - Read power on random number
 - Intialize to change RNG mode to manual run
 - Run RNG and STOP
 - Read generated random number
 - Change seed value or polynomial
 - And Run RNG and STOP again & read random number
