### Example Description 

This example shows how to use the PWM peripheral to run capture mode.

The PWM channel 0 frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz), the Prescaler is 2 
so the PWM0 counter clock is 10 MHz. SystemCoreClock is set to 20 MHz.

The PWM channel 0 is configured in Timer Mode and duty cycle is 50 %.
Timer/Counter is up-count mode and periodic mode. Capture mode is rising edge detection. 1 interrupts out of 3 interrupts
are enabled: capture interupt(match and overflow interrupt is excepted).

The Timer/Counter runs periodically and if capture signal(PC_00) is received, the Timer/Counter value is saved at capture register and capture interrupt is occurred. In capture interrupt handler, RED LED(PC_08) is toggled.

### Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with WIZnet WIZwiki W7500 platform.
  - To select the WIZnet WIZwiki platform used to run the example.
  
  - WIZwiki W7500 Set-up
    - Use the RED LED connected to PC_08 pin.
    - Use the capture input connected to PC_00 pin.
    - In order to use the RED LED(PC_08) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF1.
    - In order to use the capature intput(PC_00) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF2.
    - External input button has to be configured separately.
  
### How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - WIZwiki W7500 where the Flash memory density ranges 128Kbytes.
 - If you have any questions, please use the forum site.
