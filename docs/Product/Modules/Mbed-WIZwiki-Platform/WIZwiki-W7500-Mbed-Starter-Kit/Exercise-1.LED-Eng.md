# Blinking LED

## Outline

Users can connect the mbed platform board with the PC and compile
online. Users can also blink the LED using the example program provided
for the platform board.

## What you need

  - WIZwiki-W7500 board
  - USB cable

## Log on to mbed website

Please log on to üåé[mbed website](https://os.mbed.com)mbed website
for further testing. If you haven‚Äôt signed up yet, please sign up.
[Sign-up at ARM mbed Developer Site](./Sign-up-at-ARM-mbed-Eng.md)

#### Connect the PC with mbed platform board

Connect the PC with WIZwiki-W7500 using the USB cable.
![](/img/products/wizwiki_mbed_kit/kit_en/bd_usb_connected.jpg) The PC will
read the driver like a USB driver.

#### Open the mbed compiler

Click ‚ÄúOpen mbed Compiler‚Äù as shown below.

![](/img/products/wizwiki_mbed_kit/kit_en/105_wizwiki.png)

A pop-up will appear and ‚ÄúBlinky LED Hello World‚Äù will be set as the
template and ‚Äúmbed\_blinky‚Äù will be set as the Default program name.

![](/img/products/wizwiki_mbed_kit/kit_en/106_program_name.png)

Click OK and the mbed\_blinky program will be copied to my Program
Workspace.

![](/img/products/wizwiki_mbed_kit/kit_en/107_mbed_blinky_main.png)

Clik the Compile icon from the menu to compile the example code. Success
message will appear below if an error is not occurred during compiling.

Once compiling is successful, download the
mbed\_blinky\_WIZWIKI-W7500.bin file to the PC.

### Example Code

``` c
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut myled(LED1);

int main(/) {
    while(1) {
        myled = 1;
        wait(0.2);
        myled = 0;
        wait(0.2);
    }
}
```

### Run exercise and Check test result

Copy and paste the mbed\_blinky\_WIZWIKI\_W7500.bin file to the mbed
driver (E: or F:) ![](/img/products/wizwiki_mbed_kit/kit_en/110_copy.png)

Then press the reset pin. The LED (blue circle) shown in the below image
will blink every 0.2 second. ![WIZwiki-W7500 LED1](/img/products/wizwiki_mbed_kit/kit_en/wizwiki_led1.png)

If the LED blinks successfully, it means that the example code is
operating on the WIZwiki-W7500 board. This exercise making the LED blink
is called ‚ÄúHello World.‚Äù

Users can test with different time value of the wait function.
