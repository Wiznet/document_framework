CMSIS-DAP by ARM helps you to write firmware into MCU through USB cable.
When you write firmware into WIZwiki-W7500 with the USB cable, the
firmware has written into the CMSIS-DAP first. After that, the firmware
will write into WIZwiki-W7500. Because of this, you are require to
update the firmware for the

### To follow

   1. While pressing the Reset SW on WIZwiki-W7500, connect the USB cable to WIZwiki-W7500 and  wait for a removable disk, CRP_DISABLD, to appear.

   2. Then you can find the difference between a normal removable disk and a removable disk with pressing the **Reset SW**.
    
   3.  Delete firmware.bin existing in the CRP_DISABLD disk.
