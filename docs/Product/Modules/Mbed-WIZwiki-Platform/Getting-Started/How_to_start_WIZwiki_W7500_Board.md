When you get a WIZwiki-W7500 platform board first on your hand, the
serial driver installation and hardware test are needed. Because
WIZwiki-W7500 uses CMSIS-DAP firmware writing and serial
communicates through UART1 on W7500 (Target MCU).  

-----

## To install the serial driver

To install the serial driver from ARM mbed, please refer to the below
link.

## Hardware self-test

WIZwiki-W7500 has a built-in default firmware. You can do self-test with
the default firmware as below.

**Test Sequence**

1. Connect Ethernet cable, USB cable to WIZwiki-W7500. If you have a SD card, insert the SD card.

2. Run the Device Manager in Control panel and check which COM port is allocated to the USB port on WIZwiki-W7500.

3. Press Reset SW, then LED 'D4' on WIZwiki-W7500 will be turned on. If D4 is turned off, then press the Reset SW again.

    **Serial setting**
    Baud rate : 115200
    Data bits : 8
    Parity : None
    Stop bits : 1
    Flow : None
    
4.

    If you have a SD card,
    the state of D4 will turn like this: White => White Blink => Yellow
    The following message prints out to the serial port.

    If you do not have a SD card,
    D4 of the state will turn like this: White => White Blink => Red
    The following message prints out to the serial port.

5. Run a command window and proceed with the ping test to
WIZwiki-W7500.

6. WIZwiki-W7500 operates as loopback server.

7. Make proceed with the ping test or loopback test with an IP of
192.168.077.009 on WIZwiki-W7500.

    Necessarily, IP of the PC must also be set to 192.168.077.XXX.

8. If you can do everything well, then your WIZwiki-W7500 doesn't have
any problem.
