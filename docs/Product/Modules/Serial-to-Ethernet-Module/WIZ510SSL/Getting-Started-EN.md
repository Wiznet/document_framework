### PC Settings

Double check that the WIZ510SSL and the PC, or laptop you are using to set up WIZ510SSL with are both on the same Ethernet network.



#### Example: PC Network Settings

\* When the WIZ510SSL's settings are factory default,

| Network Settings | PC or laptop(= destination) | IP address      | 192.168.11.3 | \- |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | -- |
| :::              | :::                         | Gateway address | 192.168.11.1 | \- |
| :::              | :::                         | Port number     | 5000         | \- |

  - User should match the network settings of 'WIZ510SSL's remote host' and 'PC (or laptop)' for testing TCP client/mixed mode.

  - If the DHCP(automatic IP allocation) is used, both the WIZ510SSL and test PC must be set to be assigned the same IP from the same router.



### Connecting Steps

The **RS-232/TTL version of WIZ510SSL evaluation board** is designed to use the **DB9 connector** to connect with the user’s serial device. Therefore, it is recommended to have all **Ethernet and serial ports connected to the PC** when testing. If the PC does not have a serial port, please purchase a **RS-232 to USB converter** separately.

  - **In case of the RS-422/455 version of WIZ750SR-EVB, the serial connector is composed of terminal block.**



#### Step 1: Plug in

Connect the WIZ510SSL module to evaluation board and also the cable as shown in the picture below.

  - Ethernet Cable
    - Used to connect the evaluation board’s RJ-45 connector and the PC’s Ethernet network interface card (PC's RJ-45 connector)

  - Serial Cable
    - Used to connect the evaluation board’s DB9 connector and the serial interface card (DB9 connector). If the PC does support serial interface, use the RS-232 to USB converter.

  - Optional: USB type B cable (for debug message)
    - Used to connect the evaluation board’s USB connector and the PC’s USB connector.

#### Step 2: Power on

Connect the 5V power adaptor or USB cable to the evaluation board and turn on the power switch.

  - The power LED will turn red once the evaluation board is on.



#### Step 3: Search

Open the configuration tool and click the **Device Search** button. If the board is turned on and connected to the same network, the MAC address or settings of the WIZ510SSL module can be checked using the configuration tool.

**The WIZ510SSL configuration tool can be downloaded from Github below.**

  - [Download the latest version](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI/releases/tag/V1.4.0)
  - [Download the older versions](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI/releases)
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI)

| Figure: ***WIZnet S2E Configuration Tool***                   |



#### Step 4: Set up your WIZ510SSL

Change the settings accordingly to the customer’s environment. The test shown in this document is based on factory setting.

  * Click the **Apply Settings** button to apply the changes in settings of the configuration tool.



#### Step 5: Connect

Connect the PC as the TCP client of the user’s serial device for data communication testing. In order to do this, the serial terminal program / TCP client terminal program must be opened on the PC. The serial terminal program and TCP client program must be set as below.

  - Serial terminal program: **115200-8-N-1, Flow control: None**
  - TCP client program: **192.168.11.2:5000** (The IP address and port number of WIZ510SSL)

The COM port for serial terminal program connection can be checked as below.

  - Control Panel \> System \> Device Manager

| Figure: ***Device Manager***                        |



#### Step 6: Verify

The basic data communication of the WIZ510SSL can be verified as below.

  - **Serial to Ethernet: data communication verification**
    - Enter the character string in the serial terminal and check if the identical character string appears on the TCP client terminal.

  - **Ethernet to Serial: data communication verification**
    - Enter the character string in the TCP client terminal and check if the identical character string appears on the serial terminal.



#### Step 7: Done

Now you’re ready to use the WIZ510SSL!

  - This document is based on the **assumption of the PC as the serial device / remote network device**.

  - The next step is to **connect the WIZ510SSL module to the target serial device** and check if the device can **communicate, control, and monitor** via the **remote PC or monitoring server**.
