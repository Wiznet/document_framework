WIZnet’s configuration tool enables product search, product settings,
and firmware upload via the network\[1\]. WIZ510SSL is compatible with
WIZ107/108SR and uses the same configuration tool\[2\].

The WIZ510SSL Series Configuration Tool is published on the Github under
the name of WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI. The latest version of the executable
can be downloaded from the release page.

  - **Github repository: [WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI Github repository](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI)**
  - **Download the latest version: [WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI Github repository: Release](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZnet-S2E-Tool-GUI/releases)**

1.  Stable version is recommended for usage. Ex) Development version:
    v1.0.0dev, Stable version: v1.0.0

2.  In cases when there are multiple devices in the same network.


#### 4\) Serial command mode


  * By enabling this option, the data communication mode (GW mode) will change to serial command mode (AT mode) when sending the **command mode switch code** via the serial data port.
    * Default: Enabled
  * Use the serial command mode composed of 2-byte to change settings.
  * The existing TCP connection will be lost if the mode changes to serial command mode.


  - **Serial command mode switch code: Trigger code**
      - This is a 3-byte code for switching the mode from data mode to serial command mode.
          - Default: \[2B\]\[2B\]\[2B\] (+++)
      - Each byte value reads hex code only.



:::info
**Please take caution of the following when using Trigger code.**

1.  It can only be recognized as switch code if there is a time gap of
    at least 500ms of no data communication time before and after the
    3-byte command mode switch.
2.  The time interval for each byte of the 3-byte command mode switch
    code has to be at most 500ms.
3.  Do not end the command mode switch code\[1\] with CR((CR: Carriage
    return, ('\\r', 0x0D) )) or LF((LF: Line feed, ('\\n', 0x0A) )).
4.  The default interval of the time gap before and after the command
    mode switch code is 500ms. The operation is based on the timer value
    of the serial data packaging option.
:::


#### 5\) Connection password (TCP server mode only)

  - **Range: Up to 8-bytes string**
      - Default: Null (Not used)
  - Connection password is available for **TCP server mode** (including TCP server mode of the mixed mode).
  - TCP client must send the connection password character upon connecting to WIZ510SSL in order for data communication.
  - TCP connection will be disconnected if the password does not match

    collected and sent together.

 Data packing options can be
multi-selected but has priority as shown below.  
**Character =\> Size =\> Timer**

  - **Timer**
      - Range: 0 \~ 65535 / Unit: milliseconds (ms)
          - Default: 0 (Not used)
      - Collects the data until the designated time is lapsed and sent
        together. Will not operate if set to '0'.



  - **Size**
      - Range: 0 \~ 255 / Unit: data length (number of bytes)
          - Default: 0 (Not used)
      - Collects the data until the designated data length is reached
        and sent together.
      - Will does not operate if set to '0'.



  - **Character**
      - Range & Unit: 1-byte character (Hex code)
          - Default: 00 (Not used)
      - Collects the data until the designated character is entered and
        sent together.
      - The designated character will be included if the data size does
        not exceed the buffer size. The designated character will be
        excluded if the data size exceeds the buffer size.
      - Will does not operate if set to '0x00'.

-----

1.  Serial data can be collected according to the setting (character,
    size, or time) and be sent together.
    
#### 6\) Timer interval

  - **Inactivity Timer**
      - **Range: 0 \~ 65535 / Unit: seconds**
          - Default: 0 (Not used)
      - If inactivity timer is set, connection is lost after the
        designated time without data communication is lapsed after the
        last data is sent.
      - This setting is for **TCP Server or TCP Client mode and mixed
        mode**.



  - **Reconnection Interval**
      - **Range: 1 \~ 65535 / Unit: milliseconds (ms)**
          - Default: 3000 (Use, 3 seconds)
      - The re-connection interval is for **TCP Client Operation,
        including TCP Client of the mixed mode**.
      - This option is requires in order to re-connect TCP communication
        in case it is lost.
      - The setting must be at least 1ms.

-----

#### 7\) TCP Keep-alive interval

  - This option allows the connection status to be kept alive by sending
    the ‘keep-alive packet’ in **all three TCP modes**. (TCP server, TCP
    client, and TCP mixed mode)
      - Default: Enabled (recommended)
      - TCP connection is disconnected if there is no response to the
        ‘keep-alive’ packet. (Socket close / disconnect)
      - The ‘keep-alive’ packet is sent after the Ethernet packet is
        sent at least once from WIZ510SSL.



  - **Send Keep-Alive Interval**
      - **Range: 0 \~ 65535, Unit: milliseconds(ms)**
          - Default: 7000, 5000 (recommended, 7 seconds / 5 seconds)
