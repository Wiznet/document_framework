WIZ120SR-EVB is a evaluation board for WIZ120SR.

WIZ120SR is an embedded module based on WIZnet W5100 &  ARM Cortex-M3. WIZ120SR is the protocol converter that transmits the data sent by serial equipment as TCP/IP data type, and converts back the TCP/IP data received through the network into serial data to transmit back to the equipment. WIZ120SR is able to communicate two serial equipments at the same time by supporting 2 serial ports(3.3V LVTTL).
