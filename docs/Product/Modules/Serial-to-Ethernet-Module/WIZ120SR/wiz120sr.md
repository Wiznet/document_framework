## Overview

![](/img/products/wiz120sr/wiz12sr-1.jpg)

WIZ120SR is an embedded module based on WIZnet W5100 &  ARM Cortex-M3. WIZ120SR is the protocol converter that transmits the data sent by serial equipment as TCP/IP data type, and converts back the TCP/IP data received through the network into serial data to transmit back to the equipment. It supports two serial ports(3.3V LVTTL) so that it can communicate with two serial equipments at the same time.

## Features

- Serial to Ethernet Module based on W5100 & Cortex-M3
- Pin-header typed module
- Serial signals : 2 port serial port (3.3V LVTTL) / TXD, RXD, RTS, CTS, GND signals
- Support the configuration method of AT command & Configuration tool program
- Support password function for the security
- 10/100Mbps Ethernet & Max.230kbps serial speed
- Support WIZ VSP (Virtual Serial Port) program

## Hardware Specification

- Pin Header Connector Type : 2.5mm Pitch (1×14 & 2×14)
- Dimension (mm) : 50(L) x 30 (W) x 8.85 (H)
- Input Voltage : 3.3V
- Max. Power Consumption : 300mA
- Operation Temperature : 0 ~ 80℃
- RoHS, SVHC Compliant

## Utilities

- Configuration Tool for Windows
- WizVSP: Virtual Serial Port (COM port) for User’s Programs
