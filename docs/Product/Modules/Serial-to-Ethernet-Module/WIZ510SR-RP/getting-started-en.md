## Unpacking the WIZ510SR-RP

### What's in the Box?

The WIZ510SR-RP evaluation board package contains the following parts.

  - WIZ510SR-RP Module

The entire list of parts of the board is available at the [WIZ510SR-RP Overview: Product Contents](./overview-en.md#product-contents) page.

As WIZ510SR-RP already has Serial and Ethernet port, no separate evaluation board is needed to get started working with module.

## PC Settings

Double check that the WIZ510SR-RP and the PC, or laptop you are using to set up WIZ510SR-RP with are both in the same Ethernet network.

#### Example: PC Network Settings

When the WIZ510SR-RP's settings are factory default,

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Network Settings</th>
<th>PC or laptop<br />
(= Remote)</th>
<th>IP address</th>
<th>192.168.11.3</th>
<th>-</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>:::</td>
<td>:::</td>
<td>Gateway address</td>

- User should to matching the network settings of 'WIZ510SR-RP's remote host' and 'PC (or laptop)' for testing TCP client/mixed mode.
- If the DHCP(automatic IP allocation) is used, both the WIZ510SR-RP and test PC must be set to be assigned the same IP from the same router.

### Connecting Steps

The **WIZ510SR-RP** is designed to use the **DB9 connector** to connect with the user’s serial device. Therefore, it is recommended to have all **Ethernet and serial ports connected to the PC** when testing. If the PC does not have a serial port, please purchase a **RS-232 to USB converter** separately.

#### Step 1: Plug in

Connect cables to WIZ510SR-RP module as shown in the picture below.

- Ethernet Cable
  - Used to connect the evaluation board’s RJ-45 connector and the PC’s Ethernet network interface card (PC's RJ-45 connector)
- Serial Cable
  - Used to connect the evaluation board’s DB9 connector and the serial interface card (DB9 connector). If the PC does support serial interface, use the RS-232 to USB converter.

*Image to be added*

#### Step 2: Power on

Connect the 5V power adaptor or USB cable to the evaluation board and turn on the power switch.

- The power LED will turn red once the evaluation board is on.

*Image to be added*

#### Step 3: Search

Open the configuration tool and click the search button. If the board is turned on and connected to the same network, the MAC address or settings of the WIZ510SR-RP module can be checked using the configuration tool.

#### Step 4: Set up your WIZ510SR-RP

Change the settings accordingly to the customer’s environment. The test shown in this document is based on factory setting.

:::tip
Click **Apply Settings** button to save the changes in settings of the configuration tool.

#### Step 5: Connect

Connect the PC as the TCP client of the user’s serial device for data communication testing. In order to do this, the serial terminal program / TCP client terminal program must be opened on the PC. The serial terminal program and TCP client program must be set as below.

- Serial terminal program: **115200-8-N-1, Flow control: None**
- TCP client program: **192.168.11.2:5000** (The IP address and port number of WIZ510SR-RP)

The COM port for serial terminal program connection can be checked as below.

- Control Panel -> System -> Device Manager

|                                                                  |

| Figure: Device Manager                                           |

#### Step 6: Verify

The basic data communication of the WIZ510SR-RP can be verified as below.

- **Serial to Ethernet: data communication verification**
  - Enter the character string in the serial terminal and check if the identical character string appears on the TCP client terminal.
- **Ethernet to Serial: data communication verification**
  - Enter the character string in the TCP client terminal and check if the identical character string appears on the serial terminal. 

#### Step 7: Done

Now you’re ready to use the WIZ510SR-RP!

- This document is based on the **assumption of the PC as the serial device / remote network device**. 
- The next step is to **connect the WIZ510SR-RP module to the target serial device** and check if the device can **communicate, control, and monitor** via the **remote PC or monitoring server**.
