WIZ145SR-EVB is a evaluation board for WIZ145SR.

WIZ145SR is an embedded module mounting RJ-45 and is based on WIZnet W5300 & ARM Cortex-M3. WIZ145SR is the protocol converter that transmits the data sent by serial equipment as TCP/IP data type, and converts back the TCP/IP data received through the network into serial data to transmit back to the equipment. WIZ145SR is able to communicate four serial equipments at the same time by supporting 4 serial ports(3.3V LVTTL).
