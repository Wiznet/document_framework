  - Use **UDP broadcast, port 50001** in order to use the UDP
    Search from the configuration tool of WIZ750SR. Please test after
    closing the **OS firewall and virus programs**. 

  - If there is a problem with the UDP port, users can change the OS
    inbound / outbound port settings to open the Search & firmware
    update port (UDP/TCP 50001, TCP 50002).

  - If multiple network adaptors are used, an error can occur in sending
    the packet in the correct order of the network interface Metric.
    Deactivate all other adaptors except the one that is used for OS
    setting in order to test again.
      - This problem can occur because of the virtual Ethernet adaptor,
        which is used for the networking of Virtual Machines like VMware
        or Virtual Box is used.
