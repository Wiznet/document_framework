## Overview

![WIZ550SR Overview](/img/products/wiz550sr/wiz550sr_overview.png)

WIZ550SR is Serial to Ethernet module, It's mounted TCP/IP chip W5500 of
WIZnet and Cortex-M3-based STM32F103RCT6 of STmicro. WIZ550SR does not
contain RJ45 because very small size type. WIZ550SR provides the user
Interface 2.00mm Pitch Pin header.

WIZ550SR is the protocol converter that transmits the data sent by
serial equipment as TCP/IP data type, and converts back the TCP/IP data
received through the network into serial data to transmit back to a
serial equipment. It complies with industrial temperature standard and
supports the serial interfaces of UART.

WIZ550SR is is compatible with the Configuration Tool of WIZ550S2E and
WIZ550WEB, and will use the same AT Command.

However, Configuration Tool must use the latest version.
