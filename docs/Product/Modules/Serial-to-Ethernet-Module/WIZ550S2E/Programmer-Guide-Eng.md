## Overview

This page provides detailed information about AT commands set and how to
use the Configuration tool, which retrieves and sets all configurations
of WIZ550S2E via Ethernet. Users can change any value of the WIZ550S2E
and communicate with the peer system through TCP(or UDP) socket by
sending AT commands.

## WIZ550S2E AT Command Set

This section provides a list of WIZ550S2E AT commands and their functions. Users can input commands and parameters through USART line.

### Enter/Exit Command Mode

The command mode is entered by sending the "Trigger Code" (default 2B 2B 2B in Hex) to the serial port of the WIZ550S2E module. This three byte Trigger Code needs to be sent without any character before and after the three byte = also without CR or LF for 500ms time.  
The command mode is closed by sending "AT+MDATA/r/n" The Trigger Code can be en/disabled and also changed with the config tool.  
  
**The three byte Trigger Code need to be isolated = without CR(0x0D), LF(0x0A)** 

Every command starts with “AT”. Any other initial character will cause an error in return. Commands and parameters are all ASCII characters, i.e. when you input 'AT+NSTAT', you should input ASCII characters 'A', 'T', '+', 'N', 'S', 'T', 'A', 'T' and 'Enter Key' which is CR, LF (0x0d, 0x0A).  

**All commands should be terminated with CR(0x0D), LF(0x0A)** 

Some parameters are mandatory and others are optional. Parameters must be entered in the order of format column given by the command tables. Although the optional parameter is not used, the comma delimiters ',' must still be included in the command. In most cases, valid commands return the character \[S\] and invalid inputs return \[F\]. The possible responses sent from WIZ550S2E to the user are described as Responses. Below are examples of user input. As you can see, WIZ550S2E return
“\\r\\n” back instead of “\\r”, which means user (host system) always handle '\\r\\n' as the only delimiter.

| Input by User         | AT\\r\\n (0x61 0x74 0x0d 0x0a)         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Output from WIZ550S2E | \[S\]\\r\\n (0x5b 0x53 0x5d 0x0d 0x0a) |

### Responses

#### Response Format

`[(Type),(Id),(Param1),(Param2),(Param3),(Param4),(Param5),(Param6)]↓(Data)↓
`

  - (Type): Type of response. It can be one of **S**, **D**, **F**,
    **W**, **R** and **V**.
  - (Id): Socket Identifier. This is the mandatory in Async mode.
  - (Param1) \~ (Param6): ): These are included in case of commands
    retrieving module's setting value.
  - ↓: This means 'Enter' key as delimiter and CR, LF(0x0d, 0x0a) are
    its real value.
  - (Data): When huge data are needed, 'Data' will be followed in case
    of Type of response, D and R.

3.  Serial Configuration Section
4.  Option Configuration Section

-----

### Common Configurations

![](/img/products/wiz550s2e/wiz550s2epg_kr/configtool/common_config.png)

#### Search

The Search function is used to search for all existing WIZnet's WIZ550 series modules on the same LAN. By using UDP broadcast, it finds all modules on the same subnet, and found devices will be listed in the “Serial to Ethernet” tree(Search Window) with its MAC address.  

#### Setting

This function is used to apply your configurations.  
When you select the MAC address from the “Search Window”, the default value of the module will be displayed. Modify your configurations and click “Setting” button to apply your settings. The module will re-initialize and save the changed configurations. Users can change the configurations by the following steps.  

![](/img/products/wiz550s2e/wiz550s2epg_kr/configtool/password.png)

    1. Select the MAC address of the device which you would like to modify in the “Search Window”
    2. Modify the settings according to your needs
    3. Click the “Setting” button and then "Password Input Windows" pop up
      - Default Password is "WIZnet"
    4. Input "Setting Password" and Click "OK" button
    5. The module will be initialized by a re-booting process
    6. To verify your settings, please click ‘Search’ button and view your new settings

#### F/W Uploading

Firmware will be uploaded through TFTP. Click “F/W Uploading” Button and a popup window will shows as follow.  

![](/img/products/wiz550s2e/wiz550s2epg_kr/configtool/tftp_server_info.png)  

Server IP : TFTP Server IP

    Server Port : TFTP Server Port (TFTP default Port : 69)
    File Name : Firmware File Name
    Password : Setting Password

☞ WIZ550S2E Configure tool is not supported TFTP server. So you use TFTP
program separately.

#### Reset

This is the function which makes Module reboot. This requires password
to reboot.

#### Factory Reset

### Network Configurations

![](/img/products/wiz550s2e/wiz550s2epg_kr/configtool/network_config.png)  

#### IP 

This section is for setting WIZ550S2E mode's network information  

    IP: 
        WIZ550S2E's IP Address
    Gateway: 
        WIZ550S2E's Gateway Address
    Subnet mask: 
        WIZ550S2E's Subnet Mask
    Host IP: 
        Peer system's IP address which WIZ550S2E connects(or sends) to, 
        when its operating mode is "TCP Client","TCP Mixed" or "UDP".

☞ If you are unclear about your Local IP, Subnet Mask, Gateway
information, you have to get this information from your network
administrator. If the IP address is not correct, IP collision or network
problems may occur.  
  
#### Port

This section is for setting WIZ550S2E's Port information.

    Local port : 
        WIZ550S2E's local port number
    Remote port : 
        Peer system socket's port number which WIZ550S2E connects(or sends) to ,
        when its operating mode is "TCP Client","TCP Mixed" or "UDP".

  
#### Working Mode 

The working mode of WIZ550S2E can be divided into TCP Server, TCP Client and TCP Mixed according to the connection
establishing method, but UDP processes the data communication without connection establishment.  
  
During TCP server mode, WIZ550S2E operates as the server and waits for
the connection trial from the client. WIZ550S2E operates as the client
in TCP Client mode and tries to connect to the server’s IP and Port.
Mixed mode supports both Server and Client. The communication process of
each mode is as below.

#### TCP server mode communication

During the TCP Server mode, WIZ550S2E waits for the connection request.
TCP Server mode can be useful when the monitoring center attempts to
connect to the device, while WIZ550S2E is installed, in order to check
the status or provide commands. Normally WIZ550S2E is on the waiting
status, and if connection request (SYN) from the monitoring center is
received, the connection is established (ESTABLISH), and data
communication is processed (Data Transaction), and finally connection is
closed (FIN). In order to operate this mode, “Device IP”, “Subnet mask”,
“Gateway” and “Local port” should be configured first.

For TCP server mode communication, all network configurations including
Local IP, Subnet, Gateway and Local port number should be set correctly.

The Data transmission proceeds as below.

1.  The host connects to the WIZ550S2E which is configured as TCP Server mode.
2.  As the connection is established, data can be transmitted in both directions 

``` 
(host -> WIZ550S2E / WIZ550S2E -> host)
```

#### TCP client mode communication

If WIZ550S2E is set as TCP Client, it tries to establish connection to
the TCP server. To operate this mode, “Device IP”, “Subnet mask”,
“Gateway”, “Remote host”, and “Remote port” should be set. If “Remote
host” has a domain name, you should use the “DNS server” field. In TCP
Client mode, WIZ550S2E can actively establish a TCP connection to a host
computer when power is supplied.

The Data transmission proceeds as below:

1.  As power is supplied, WIZ550S2E board operating as TCP client mode actively establishes a connection to the TCP server.
2.  If the connection is complete, data can be transmitted in both directions



``` 
(host -> WIZ550S2E / WIZ550S2E -> host)
```

#### TCP Mixed mode Communication

In this mode, WIZ550S2E normally operates as TCP Server and waits for
the connection request from the peer. However, if WIZ550S2E receives
data from the serial device before connection is established, it changes
to the TCP client mode and sends the data to the TCP server IP.
Therefore, during TCP mixed mode, the TCP server mode is operated prior
to the TCP client mode.  
  
Like TCP Server mode, the TCP Mixed mode is useful in case where the
monitoring center attempts to connect to the serial device, while
WIZ550S2E is used, to check the device status. In addition to this, if
any emergency occurs in the serial device, the module will change to TCP
Client mode to establish the connection to the TCP server and deliver
the emergency status of the device.

#### UDP mode Communication

UDP is not a connection oriented protocol but the communication port
should be defined well. If UDP mode is selected, the data from serial
interface can be defined where to deliver via the “Remote host” and
“Remote port.” The WIZ550S2E can also be defined where to receive
Ethernet data from via the “Remote host” and “Local port” definition.  
  
If the data destination and source are the same, the two IP addresses
will also be the same. Please note that the destination and source are
using the same port.  

#### Timer

#### Inactivity

When there is no data transmission, the connection will close
automatically after the specified inactivity time. If the default value
‘0’ is set as the Inactivity time, the network connection is
maintained even though there is no data transmission. In this case, you
should use the ‘Close’ command to close the connection.  
  
This function is useful when there are two or more systems connected to
the WIZ550S2E module. If one system is connected to the WIZ550S2E, other
systems cannot connect to the module simultaneously. Therefore, the
inactivity time should be set and the other system can connect to the
module after the inactivity time is elapsed.  
  
Inactivity Time can also be used if the TCP server system unexpectedly
shuts down. In this case, there is no data communication, and WIZ550S2E
will close the connection and enter into waiting state if the defined
inactivity time elapses.

#### Reconnection

This is the interval time which WIZ550S2E tries to connect again after
connection is closed. This is valid only in "TCP Client" or "TCP Mixed"
having data from serial prior to TCP connection is established.

capable to control the module through serial terminal (AT command).  
  
Module Default setting: Enable  
Default trigger to AT command: 2B 2B 2B in Hex. 

#### Packing Conditions

Normally, data received from UART are sent to Ethernet immediately. But in many cases, users want to send data as a
chunk of the whole frame without separated ones. This option is for packetizing data into one frame.

    Time (0 ~ 65535 ms, ‘0’: Function Disable) : 
        This field is for specifying time value (in ms) to judge whether one frame 
        is received totally. If the time specified in this field is expired 
        after receiving one byte, then WIZ550S2E notice one data frame is finished, 
        make an Ethernet packet with all data in its serial buffer and send it to 
        the peer system via Ethernet. 
        If WIZ550S2E receives another byte from UART before the specified time is expired, 
        it restart timer and add the received one to the end of serial data buffer.
    Size (0 ~ 255 byte, ‘0’: Function Disable) : 
        This field is for specifying size value to judge whether one frame is 
        received totally. If the size specified in this field is received, then WIZ550S2E 
        notice one data frame is finished, make an Ethernet packet with specifying size's 
        data in its serial buffer and send it to the peer system via Ethernet.       
    Char : 
        This field is for specifying delimiter value to judge whether one frame is 
        received totally. Char delimiters can be set up to 4 bytes in HEX and valid 
        character count is decided according to the value in Length field. In case the 
        value of Length field is '0', this option becomes inactivated. 
        Appendix is another option for this. If user selects any value in Appendix field,
        WIZ550S2E make an ethernet packet with all received data by Char delimiter and 
        next bytes in counts, which designated by Appendix field. 
        When Appendix is set with any value, not '0', even though WIZ550S2E received Char 
        delimiters, it will wait until it receives next data.

### Options Configurations

![](/img/products/wiz550s2e/wiz550s2epg_kr/configtool/option_config.png)

#### Module Name

The device name is displayed in this area.  
User can use this name to distinguish this module with others

#### Password

This is password field for authentication.  

    Setting Password : 
        Setting Password for Configuration Tool. Critical functions like "Setting", 
        "Firmware Upload","Reset" and "Factory Reset" need this password to try issued 
        action and avoid unauthorized users' command.
        When user wants to change its default Setting Password with new one, put new 
        one in this field.
    Connection Password : 
        When WIZ550S2E is TCP server, it needs connection password to check whether TCP 
        client is an unauthorized user or not. After TCP Client is connected, it must 
        transfer correct "Connection Password" within 3 seconds. Otherwise, WIZ550S2E 
        will close its TCP connection.

#### DHCP

This decides how to obtain IP address. If user selects "Use DHCP" then
WIZ550S2E will obtain IP address dynamically by DHCP operation.
Otherwise, it will operate in static mode.  

    Static mode :  
      If user uses this mode by deselecting "Use DHCP", 
      user has to set WIZ550S2E with specific network information.  
      1) First, select "MAC address" in "Search Windows"  
      2) Then, IP setting section will be activated  
      3) Fill those fields with information which user want to set.  
      4) And press "Setting" button then network information will be 
         changed with value user entered.
    DHCP mode :
      WIZ550S2E's network information will be set automatically without user's interference.

#### DNS

This is valid in TCP Client mode only. Normally, TCP Client mode has to
know its peer system's IP address. But there are some cases where the IP
address is unknown and especially when the IP address change
frequently.  
In this case, DNS function is needed.

User has to select “Use DNS” option and set DNS Server IP address and
peer systems' Domain name in string. Put DNS Server IP, provided by ISP,
into “DNS Server IP” field and peer system's Domain name into “Domain”
field.
