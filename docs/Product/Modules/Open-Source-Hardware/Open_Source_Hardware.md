## What's the Open Source Hardware?

![](/img/osh/overview/oshw_logo.jpg) Open-source hardware consists of physical artifacts
of technology designed and offered by the open design movement. Both
free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware is
created by this open-source culture movement and applies a like concept
to a variety of components. The term usually means that information
about the hardware is easily discerned. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical
drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source
code and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to the software
that drives the hardware, are all released with the FOSS approach.

## Open Source Hardware Definition 1.0

Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available
so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design
or hardware based on that design. The hardware's source, the design from
which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making
modifications to it. Ideally, open source hardware uses
readily-available components and materials, standard processes, open
infrastructure, unrestricted content, and open-source design tools to
maximize the ability of individuals to make and use hardware. Open
source hardware gives people the freedom to control their technology
while sharing knowledge and encouraging commerce through the open
exchange of designs. Open Source Hardware
Association(ðŸŒŽ[OSHWA](http://2013.oshwa.org/)) set the ðŸŒŽ[Statement of
Principles and Definition v1.0](http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW).

## Open Source Hardware using WIZnet chip

ðŸŒŽ[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) is an open-source electronics
prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and
software. WIZnetâ€™ chip and module are being used in the Arduinoâ€™s
Ethernet Shield, and adopted in its clones. ![](/img/osh/overview/platform_img3.gif)
