## Overview

This document provides programmers with all commands and explanations
about WizFi250 control. Basically programmers can control WizFi250 with
commands set, known as AT command – the character string format. In this
document, we describe what AT commands are used, how each command
operates and how programmers have to handle those commands to get the
expected response.

## AT Command Set

This section provides a list of WizFi250 AT commands and their effects.
Users can input commands and parameters through USART line. Every
command starts with the characters “AT”. Any other initial character
will cause an error in return. Commands and parameters are all ASCII
characters, e.g. When you input 'AT+MMSG=1', you can input ASCII
characters 'A', 'T', '+', 'M', 'M', 'S', 'G', '=', '1' and 'Enter Key'
which should be CR(0x0d), but neither CRLF(0x0d, 0x0a) nor LF(0x0a).  
  
Some parameters are mandatory and the others are optional. (refer to
[Command Tables](#command-list))
Parameters must be entered in an order of format column given by the
command tables. Even though an optional parameter is not used, the comma
delimiters must still be included in the command. In most cases, valid
commands return the characters \[OK\]. Invalid inputs return \[ERROR\].
The possible responses sent by WizFi250 to the user side are described
at [Responses](#responses).
Below is a possible example which users can input. As you can see,
WizFi250 return "\\r\\n" back instead of "\\r", which means user (host
system) always handle '\\r\\n' as a only delimiter.

|**input by user**|AT\r (0x61 0x74 0x0d)|
|-------|---|
|**Output from WizFi250**|AT\r\n[OK]\r\n (0x0d 0x0a 0x5b 0x4f 0x4b 0x5d 0x0d 0x0a)(* “AT\r\n” is Echo back of user input)|

#### AT+WJOIN
  
- **Format:** 

```
AT+WJOIN
```

- **Meaning:** WiFi Association

In the **STA** mode, it joins with the BSS selected by AT+WSET, AT+WSEC.  
And in the **AP** mode, it starts to run as an Access Point.

* There are 2 Wi-Fi modes in WizFi250, STA mode and SoftAP mode. When users execute AT+WJOIN command, the current Wi-Fi mode works as the one previously selected by user input. It can be selected or checked by AT+WSET and AT+WSEC commands, and it is the only way to handle Wi-Fi mode.
* SoftAP mode does not support WEP security method.


- **Response:**
```
Joining : (SSID)
Successfully joined : (SSID)
    
[Link-Up Event]
IP Addr    : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Gateway   : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

```
```
Already Associated :
(Mode)
[OK]
```

#### AT+WLEAVE
 
- **Format:** 

```
AT+WLEAVE
```

- **Meaning:** WiFi Disassociation

 In the STA mode, it leaves current BSS, but in the SoftAP mode, it stops to run as Access Point.


- **Response:**
```

```

- **Meaning:** Socket Open/Connect ( User can use max 8 sockets. )

Opens a socket and if it is a TCP Client, establishes TCP connection with remote peer device.  
  
&lt;OpenType&gt;: Socket open type (Required)

| Parameter | Meaning                              |

| S         | register as a Service                |
| SO        | open at Once & register as a Service |

\* AT ONCE: Assigns a socket immediately and if the socket is a TCP Client, tries to connect peer socket.  
  
\* AS SERVICE: Registers its information to the profile. When WiFi Joined, socket open/connect will be performed automatically. If you want to use this after reset, It should be saved by using AT+MPROF=S.

&lt;SocketType&gt;: Socket protocol to use (Required)

### Command mode & Data mode

There are two user interface modes between WizFi250 and User-System.  
  
**Command mode** is the default communication mode and all AT Commands can be used only at this mode. Through AT Commands, users can do 'WiFi Configuration', 'Sending/Receiving Data', 'Managing System', and so on. WizFi250 treats all received data from users as AT command. If all received data follows the correct command format, WizFi250 processes it and returns a proper response to user.  
  
**Data mode**, on the other hand, is the mode which passes data of application layers to peer devices directly, without AT commands or any other interventions. It can be considered as a black box which passes all USART input to USART output directly. Its concept is simple but to enter this mode, Users need to set the environment properly through AT Commands.

#### Entering Data mode

Users can enter Data mode by writing '1' at '&lt;DataMode&gt;' parameter of AT+SCON command. Make sure that there are no open sockets before performing this, because Data mode works with one socket only. (So if you try to open another socket in data mode it will fail). If the socket of Data mode is closed, the mode will be changed to Command mode automatically so users can input AT Commands. If users set AT+SCON command as service with data mode option and save the profile, Data mode will be started when WiFi is joined, so the user does not need to set environments anymore. If the system boots or reboots at that time, WiFi Join will also be started automatically. Users can exit from data mode temporally by entering '+++' in a row (Wait for a second until \[OK\]
response show up). Any AT Command can be entered during Data mode except AT+SCON command. If you want to return to data mode again, you just need to enter AT+SDATA. If you want to exit Data mode completely, close the socket by using 'AT+SMGMT=0' or 'AT+SMGMT=ALL'.

#### Data transmission in Command mode

In Command mode, you can make more than one socket, and you can send/receive data through opened sockets at the same time by using AT Command. You can send data to specific socket opened through AT+SSEND command and receive data with information header which informs you on the socket number, the peer address and the received data length.

### Example of Multi Socket Connection

This section explains how to use < Multi Socket Connection> function. WizFi250 can use max 8 TCP or UDP sockets. In order to use < Multi Socket Connection> function, you can use AT command as below. In this example, the peer system was running a loop back program. So if peer system received data from WizFi250, peer system will send received data to WizFi250.

### Air Command mode - WizFi250AirCmd

This section explains how to operate Air-command-mode of WizFi250. With this Air-command-mode included in the WizFi250, you can issue AT commands to the module via WiFi, while the WizFi250 is in the TCP server or UDP server operation mode.

Please have a look at the following hints:

- Air-command-mode should only be used for configuration of WizFi250. It is not recommended to use the command mode for other purpopses.
- The Air-command-mode will automatically be started, when the module WizFi250 will be booted into the AP mode. The module can then be configured on the port 50001 on its IP address.

The AT command consists of following parts: Command header (WizFi250AirCmd:), AT command (for example: AT) and Carriage Return (\r).

The command should be sent with these conditions:

- The command header “WizFi250AirCmd:” is case sensitive and has to be sent in this kind. It is 15 Bytes long.
- A < Carriage Return, 0x1d> has to follow the AT command directly.
- Air-command header, AT command and Carriage Return should be combined into one packet.

Example usage of the WizFi250AirCmd:

      AT+WSET=1,WizFi250_AIRCMD
      [OK]
      AT+WSEC=1,WPA2,123456789
      [OK]
      AT+WNET=0,192.168.11.1,255.255.255.0,192.168.11.1
      [OK]
      AT+WJOIN

      [Link-Up Event]
        IP Addr    : 192.168.11.1
        Gateway    : 192.168.11.1
      [OK]

      AT+MAIRCMD=O,T,50001,0
      [OK]

Now, TCP Client can connect to the WizFi250 and issue the AT commands via WiFi as below.

      (TCP Client TX) 
      WizFi250AirCmd:AT+MINFO\r (24 Byte)
      (RX) 
      FW version/HW version
      1.0.1.8/WizFi250 Rev 1.0
      [OK]

      (TCP Client TX) 
      WizFi250AirCmd:AT+WSEC=?\r (25 Byte)
      (RX) 
      1,WPA2,123456789
      [OK]

      (TCP Client TX) 
      WizFi250AirCmd:AT+WSEC=1,WPA2,aaaabbbb\r (39 Byte)
      (RX) 
      [OK]

      (TCP Client TX) 
      WizFi250AirCmd:AT+MMAC=?\r (25 Byte)
      (RX) 
      00:08:DC:00:55:76
      [OK]
