### WiFi

#### Hardware

To use WiFi functions it is necessary to install jumper on 2x2 Pin Header as shown in image above.

| WiFi | MCU |
| ---- | --- |
| RX   | TX  |
| TX   | RX  |

#### Software

WizFi310 is connected to the main chip (ATmega 2560) by serial (Serial #3) inside of WizArduino MEGA WIFI. It is necessary to initialize it as below.

```cpp
#include "WizFi310.h"
void setup()
{
    Serial3.begin(115200);
    WiFi.init(&Serial3);
}
```
Please refer to [**Examples/IoT**](#examples) section for more information on WiFi usage.

## FAQ

<details><summary>
What are the differences between WizFi310 and other WiFi modules?
</summary>
WizFi310 description

There are many Embedded WiFi modules these days, and the technology has been leveled to some extent (except for some low-cost WiFi modules), so there is no special difference in specifications or features.

- Control using AT Command through UART interface.
- 802.11 bgn support.
- Support for WEP, WPA/WPA2, TKIP/AES.
- Support for Soft AP mode.
- It can be set up/controlled using a smartphone.
- TCP/UDP, SSL, MQTT/MQTTS, and multi-socket support.
- WizFi 310 also supports all of the above specifications.

However, it is a product developed directly by Wiznet, so we can say that its advantage is that WizFi310 can be easily connected to IoT platforms of domestic telecommunication companies such as SKT Thingplug and KT IoT Makers.

The Wiznet Academy provides training sessions for using WizFi310 with SKT Thingplug, which has a built-in ThingPlug connection, and KT IoTMakers is registered as the official Compatible Product (for the first time as a WiFi module).

- [Training](http://wiznetacademy.com/index.php?module=lecture&act=dispLectureView&lecture_seq=2253&schedule_seq=3)
- [GIGA IoTMakers](https://iotmakers.kt.com/openp/index.html#/home)

It would be a particularly good choice for customers who want to connect to SKT or KT's IoT platforms through Wi-Fi.

<summary>
What is WiFi range?
</summary>
As a result of internal testing, WizFi310 signal can range up to 160m outdoors. (However, in this case, there could be a difference in performance depending on the antenna of the router used.)
