## Start Serial to Wi-Fi

This chapter describes how to set WizFi310 in order to exchange data with peer system. This picture shows the environment for testing Serial to Wi-Fi example. In this example, WizFi310 is set to TCP server and peer system is set to TCP client. And then data can be exchanged between WizFi310 and the peer system.

#### Using Serial Command

This section explains how to connect to AP by using serial command. The default value which module will start is command mode, so users can input AT command. If you input the AT commands as below, WizFi310 will connect to AP and then start TCP server. In the example, AP is set like as such. ( SSID : WizFiDemoAP, Security : WAP2, Key : 12345678 )

    AT                     (Sent AT command with 0x0d (Hex of Enter button))
    [OK]                          (response meaning successful execution)

    AT+WSET=0,WizFiDemoAP     (AT command for setting WiFi association)
    [OK]

    AT+WSEC=0,,12345678       (AT command for setting WiFi security)
    [OK]

    AT+WNET=1 (AT command for setting DHCP)
    [OK]

    AT+WJOIN                      (AT command executing AP association)
    Joining : WizFiDemoAP
    Successfully joined : WizFiDemoAP

    [Link-Up Event]
     IP Addr    : 192.168.3.104
     Gateway   : 192.168.3.1
    [OK]

    AT+SCON=SO,TSN, , ,5000,1      (AT command for setting TCP Server)
    [OK]

    [CONNECT 0]       (When TCP connection is done, it shows this message)

If it is done successfully, Mode LED will be on because WizFi310 is set to < data mode >. For more detailed information about < data mode >, refer to ðŸŒŽ[Command mode & Data mode](/)
In order to exit data mode or enter into command mode again, You have to send a single '+++' string without CR or LF (0x0D, 0x0A) - just the three (0x2B = '+') characters.

#### Exchanging data with a peer system
This section explains how to exchange data between WizFi310 and Peer System.
This picture describes the flow for data communication.

After TCP connection is done successfully and then if WizFi310 receives serial data, the serial data will be sent to peer system immediately. And WizFi310 can receive data from peer system.
