## Example - Data Communication

#### Method of setting TCP Client and exchanging data in Data Mode 

##### Socket Open

This section explains how to open &#60;TCP Client Socket&#62;
and communicate with peer system. Below is an example showing how to set
TCP Client and change the mode to data mode. It also explains parameters
of &#60;AT+SCON&#62; command.  
  
(AT+SCON=&#60;OpenType&#62;,&#60;SocketType&#62;,&#60;RemoteIP&#62;,&#60;RemotePort&#62;,&#60;LocalPort&#62;,&#60;DataMode&#62;)  
  
If you enter &#60;O&#62; or &#60;SO&#62; value to &#60;Open Type&#62; parameter, WizFi310
will try to connect to TCP Server immediately. But when using &#60;S&#62;
value, WizFi310 will try to connect to TCP Server after reboot and you
have to set &#60;SocketType&#62;,&#60;RemoteIP&#62;,&#60;RemotePort&#62; and &#60;LocalPort&#62;
as below  
In order to set WizFi310 to data mode, you have to enter 1 value to
&#60;Data Mode&#62; parameter of &#60;AT+SCON&#62; command. For detailed information
to this command, refer to
[AT+SCON](./AT_Commands.md#atscon).  

  * Mode: Data Mode, TCP Client
  * Remote IP : 192.168.12.102
  * Remote Port : 5000
  * Local Port : 5001


```cpp
AP Association                    ( Refers to Association & Disassociation Example )

AT+SCON=O,TCN,192.168.12.102,5000,5001,1 ( AT command connecting with a TCP Client Socket )
[OK]

[CONNECT 0]                          <= At this point, a TCP connection is done 
```

  
##### Exchanging data with a peer system

If WizFi310 successfully connects to a peer system, WizFi310 will print [CONNECT(CID)] message and enter data mode. In data mode, WizFi310 can send serial data to peer system and receive network data from peer system without other
translation. 

##### Socket Close

In order to close TCP connection, WizFi310 has to switch to AT Command Mode. ( When +++ message entered, WizFi310 can be changed to AT Command Mode. ) After being changed to AT Command Mode,TCP Connection can be closed by using &#60;AT+SMGMT=CID&#62; or &#60;AT+SMGMT=ALL&#62; command.  

**Checking Socket Status**

After being changed to AT Command Mode, TCP
Connection can be closed by using &#60;AT+SMGMT=CID&#62; or &#60;AT+SMGMT=ALL&#62;
command.

    AT+SMGMT=?
    Number of Sockets : 1 (SCID/Socket/Mode/Remote/Local/DataMode)
    0/TCN/192.168.12.23:5000/5001/1
    [OK]
    
    
#### Method of setting TCP Server and exchanging data in Data Mode

AT+SCON=O,USN, , ,5000,1
[OK]

[CONNECT 0]                  <= At this point, a UDP connection is done 
```

**Exchanging data with a peer system**

&#60;UDP Server Mode&#62; can connect UDP connection without peer system
information like IP address and port number. But before peer system is
connected to WizFi310, WizFi310 does not send data to peer system
because WizFi310 does not know its information. Thus peer system must
send data to WizFi310 in order to know peer systemâ€™s information like
below. ![](/img/products/wizfi310/wizfi310pg/udp_server_caution.png) The
other information for exchanging data is same as [Exchanging data with a
peer system](#exchanging-data-with-a-peer-system).

**Socket Close**

Closing socket connection is the same as previous [Socket Close](#socket-close).

**Checking Socket Status**

Checking socket status is the same as previous [Checking Socket Status](#checking-socket-status).  
  

#### Method of setting TCP Client and exchanging data in Command Mode

  
**Socket Open**

This section explains how to set &#60;TCP Client&#62; in&#60;Command Mode&#62; and communicate to peer system. Below is the example for setting TCP Client on the Command Mode . In order to enter in the Command Mode, you have to enter 0 value to &#60;Data Mode&#62; parameter of
&#60;AT+SCON&#62; command. For detailed information to this command, refer to
[AT+SCON](./AT_Commands.md#atscon)  

  * Mode : Command Mode, TCP Client
  * Remote IP: 192.168.12.23
  * Remote Port : 5000
  * Local Port : 5001


```

[OK]

[CONNECT 0]                            &#60;= At this point, a TCP connection is done 
```
##### Exchanging data with a peer system

If WizFi310 connects to peer system successfully, WizFi310 will print
[CONNECT(CID)] message. At this time, WizFi310 is in command mode. In
order to send data to peer system, you have to use &#60;AT+SSEND=CID,
Destination IP, Destination Port, Data Length&#62; command. If you input
serial command like &#60;Data Length&#62; , WizFi310 will send serial data to
peer system.

    AT+SSEND=0,,,5   ( Sending data to a Socket with CID 0 )
    Hello             &#60;= When serial data is 5byte, WizFi310 send this data to peer system
    [OK]
    
    \{0,192.168.12.23,5000,11\}Hi WizFi310  ( Receiving data from pear system )

##### Socket Close

In &#60;AT Command Mode&#62;, TCP connection can be closed through
&#60;AT+SMGMT=CID&#62; or &#60;AT+SMGMT=ALL&#62; command.

##### Checking Socket Status

In &#60;AT Command Mode&#62;, Information of connected sockets are shown by
using &#60;AT+SMGMT=?&#62; command.

    AT+SMGMT=?
    Number of Sockets : 1 (SCID/Socket/Mode/Remote/Local/DataMode)

## Example - Socket Connection with Domain name

  
When you want to connect the Web Server. you have to use the AT+SCON
Command. but the parameters of AT+SCON are IP and Port instead of Domain
name.  
When It case, It is useful to use AT+SDNAME for getting the IP from
Domain name.  
AT+SDNAME=&#60;Domain Name&#62;  
Destination IP would be set using DNS Query when this Command set.

## Example - Auto re-connection

  
Some times you need to set WizFi310 which can be set for TCP
re-connection automatically. If you use AT+FSOCK command as below, you
can use WizFi310 in order to retry connection automatically.

  
  
AT+FSOCK=6,n  
  
This command means that WizFi310 will check every &#60;n&#62; seconds whether
socket is connected or not. If socket is not connected during &#60;n&#62;
second, WizFi310 will retry connection. ( For using AT+FSCOK command,
AT+SCON command is set to &#60;S&#62; or &#60;SO&#62; option. )

## Example - Air Command 
This section explains how to operate Air-command-mode of WizFi310. With
this Air-command-mode included in the WizFi310, you can issue AT
commands to the module via WiFi, while the WizFi310 is in the TCP server
or UDP server operation mode.

Please have a look at the following hints:


  * Air-command-mode should only be used for configuration of WizFi310. It is not recommended to use the command mode for other purpopses.
  * The Air-command-mode will automatically be started, when the module WizFi310 will be booted into the AP mode. The module can then be configured on the port 50001 on its IP address.


The AT command consists of following parts: Command header
(`WizFi310AirCmd:`), AT command (for example:'' AT`) and Carriage Return
(`r'').

The command should be sent with these conditions:

  * The command header "WizFi310AirCmd:" is case sensitive and has to be sent in this kind. It is 15 Bytes long. 
  * A &#60;Carriage Return, 0x0d&#62; has to follow the AT command directly.
  * Air-command header, AT command and Carriage Return should be combined into one packet.


Example usage of the WizFi310AirCmd:

![](/img/products/wizfi310/wizfi310pg/aircmd_intro.png)  
&#62;

    AT+WSET=1,WizFi310_AIRCMD
    [OK]
    AT+WSEC=1,WPA2,123456789
    [OK]
    AT+WNET=0,192.168.11.1,255.255.255.0,192.168.11.1
    [OK]
    AT+WJOIN

    [Link-Up Event]
    IP Addr : 192.168.11.1
    Gateway : 192.168.11.1
    [OK]

    AT+MAIRCMD=O,T,50001,0
    [OK]

Now, TCP Client can connect to the WizFi310 and issue the AT commands
via WiFi as below.
&#62;

    (TCP Client TX) 
    WizFi310AirCmd:AT+MINFOr (24 Byte)
    (RX) 
    FW version/HW version
    1.0.0.0/WizFi310 Rev 1.0
    [OK]

    (TCP Client TX) 
    WizFi310AirCmd:AT+WSEC=?r (25 Byte)
    (RX) 
    1,WPA2,123456789
    [OK]

    (TCP Client TX) 
    WizFi310AirCmd:AT+WSEC=1,WPA2,aaaabbbbr (39 Byte)
    (RX) 
    [OK]

    (TCP Client TX) 
    WizFi310AirCmd:AT+MMAC=?r (25 Byte)
    (RX) 
    00:08:DC:00:55:76
    [OK]


## Example - Serial to Wi-Fi Setting using Android App

  
If you use &#60;Air Command&#62;, You can configure WizFi310 using device
which can use TCP like &#60;Android App&#62;.  

#### WizFi310 Setting

In order to config the WizFi310 using Android APP, WizFi310 should
operate as SoftAP mode.
