### Overview

WIZ-IP55 is a network offloading module that integrates the W5500 chip (with built-in PHY physical layer and TCP/IP hardware protocol stack) and an RJ45 connector with integrated network transformer. As a plug-and-play component, it enables seamless interface connection between the W5500 and the transformer without the need for additional circuit design.

For users who wish to quickly develop networked systems, WIZ-IP55 is an ideal choice.
