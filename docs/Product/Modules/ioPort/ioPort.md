## Overview

WIZnet ioPort includes two types of solution. 

**Type 1**: ioPort is working as network module used iEthernet chip within a MAG-JACK (RJ45 with X’FMR). As no effort is required to interface iEthernet chip and Transformer, ioPort is the ideal option for users who want to develop their Internet enabling system rapidly.

**Type 2**: ioPort is working as a serial to ethernet module (S2E) using WIZnet's iMCU within a MAG-JACK (RJ45 with X'FMR). The ‘Serial to Ethernet’ (S2E) Products are the gateway that converts UART (TTL, RS-232 or RS-422/485) protocol into TCP/IP. It enables remote gauging, managing and control of TCP/IP devices through a UART serial interface.
