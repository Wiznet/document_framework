### Overview

WIZ810Sio is the internet offload network module that includes W5100S (TCP/IP hardwired chip, include PHY), MAG-JACK (RJ45 with Xâ€™FMR) with
other glue logics. It can be used as a component and no effort is
required to interface W5100S and Transformer. The WIZ810Sio is an ideal
option for users who want to develop their Internet enabling systems
rapidly.
