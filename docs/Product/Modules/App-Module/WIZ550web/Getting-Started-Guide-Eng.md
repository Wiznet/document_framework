### SD card Initialization

The WIZ550web uses a Micro SD card as a storage media for web content.
The SD card isn't included with module. The SD card supports
**FAT**\[1\] file system format and we recommend to use FAT32.

The process for using the SD card as a storage media for web content of
WIZ550web is described below.

#### The process for using the SD card (for Windows)

1. Format a Micro SD card with FAT32 file system

Insert the Micro SD card into an SD card reader and format it with the
Windows explorer

![](/img/products/wiz550web/sdcard/sdcard_format_process_box.jpg)

![](/img/products/wiz550web/sdcard/sdcard_format_warning_box.jpg)

![](/img/products/wiz550web/sdcard/sdcard_format_complete.jpg)

2. Download the demo web page from [WIZ550web GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZ550web)

![](/img/products/wiz550web/sdcard/sdcard_github_clone_box.jpg)

3. Copy the demo Web page to the Micro SD card

![](/img/products/wiz550web/sdcard/sdcard_webpage_folder_merge_box.jpg)

4. Insert the Micro SD card into the SD card slot of WIZ550web

5. After powering up the module you can access the webserver.

### Data flash Initialization

**We support storage method of data flash as well as SD card after v1.1.0 release.**
[https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZ550web/releases](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZ550web/releases)

1.  You can use one of a SD card and a data flash. The mount priority of
    a SD card is higher than a data flash.
2.  If you wish to use a SD card, you must copy the web page to a SD
    card and insert a SD card into a slot.
3.  If there is no SD card after 3 seconds, you can use a data flash.
    1.  You must have the initialization process of data flash.(at least
        once)
    2.  When SW1 and SW2 are pressed at the same time, the data flash is
        initialized by FatFs. And reset a target.
    3.  You must copy the web page to a data flash by FTP client
        tool.([ALFTP](http://www.altools.com/ALTools/ALFTP.aspx))

### Serial Debug Message

When power is applied to the WIZ550web module, the serial debug message
is print out via UART1 port. This message contains information such as
the device name, network configurations, and SD card info.

![](/img/products/wiz550web/wiz550webgsg/serialdebug_terminal_initial_cut.jpg)

The module will not work during the
initialization routine of the WIZ550web firmware if either the **PHY
link status** or **SD Card mount** is not operational.

**Please check the following if the module is not working.**

1.  **LAN cable connection and Link status (Act LED of the LAN port)**
2.  **SD card mount status (insertion)**

The factory default setting of UART1 is as below and the user can change
settings through the demo web pages & AT commands.

  - **115200-8-N-1**
      - Baud Rate : 115200
      - Data Bit : 8
      - Parity : NONE
      - Stop Bit : 1
      - Flow Control : NONE

## WIZ550web Web Server

-----

### Web Server Basic Operations

Common web servers and browsers communicate as follows.

1.  Web browser (user's Webpage) sends HTTP request to web server
2.  Web server processes the user's request and prepare the results
3.  Web server sends HTTP response to web browser
4.  Repeat step 1 \~ 3 above

Therefore, Web server (HTTP server) of WIZ550web is consists the
following processes and operates as the flowchart below.

  - **HTTP Request Parser**
      - Parse the HTTP Request
  - **Web Content (web resources) Loader**
      - Find the requested web content from the web content storage
        (e.g., SD card) and prepare the response
  - **HTTP Response Sender**
      - Send the HTTP response to web browser
      - Response vary depending on the processing results
          - Successful HTTP requests : HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          - The requested resource could not be found : HTTP/1.1 404 Not
            Found
  - **CGI Handler**
      - Process the **User's requests** from web browser
      - CGI is the used to set the I/O status or to get the I/O status
        information![](/img/products/wiz550web/wiz550webgsg/wiznet_httpserver_flowchart_v1.png)

-----

### CGI for WIZ550web

WIZ550web uses CGI to configure the network or monitor and control the
I/O.

CGI is an acronym for 'Common Gateway Interfaceâ€™ and it operates the
server's program and receives results of the client via web. CGI is not
dependent on a particular language or platform because only the
configuration and policies between the web page and the server needs to
be satisfied.

![](/img/products/wiz550web/wiz550webgsg/wiz550web_simple_server-client_diagram.png)

CGI for WIZ550web consists the 'Request name + .cgi' using HTTP GET/POST
request method. The CGI for each HTTP methods are handled as below.

**GET**

  - The method for getting the values from web server
  - Passed in the form of a **JavaScript callback function parameters**
      - Same structures as **JSON**
      - The function name in the HTTP response body must be the same on
        the Web page's JavaScript Callback function name
      - e.g., If the 'function IoStatusCallback' is Javascript function
        name in the Web page, web server must pass the data as next;
        `IoStatusCallback({"din":[{"v":"1"}, {"v":"0"}],
        "led":[{"v":"1"}, {"v":"0"}]})`

**POST**

  - The method for putting the changed values to web server
  - Values are passing by the **Web form element**
  - **Name-value pairs**; Each pair is separated by '&' and the
    Name/value of a pair is represented by '='
      - e.g., 'Pin : 1, Val : 1' => 'Pin=1 & Val=1'

Each requests are handled by **AJAX** techniques for efficient data
processing in the limited resources embedded web server. The advantage
is that the server avoids the full web page reload and reduces the load
on the server.

**Favicon**  

Favicon is a complex word of 'favorites' and 'icon', and is displayed as
a small icon in the address bar / tabs of web browser (e.g., Google
Chrome, MS Internet Explorer). By using this, the user is able to know
the provider of the web page. The example basic demo web pages include
'favicon'.

![](/img/products/wiz550web/webpage_basicdemo/favicon_ex.jpg)

User can add the 'Favicon' as the following steps

1.  Create the target image to 16x16 sized icon and save in the name of
    'favicon.ico'
2.  Move the 'favicon.ico' to web content storage
3.  Insert the link code at the top of the 'index.html' page

e.g., ```<link rel='shortcut icon' href='/favicon.ico' type='image/x-icon'>```

## WIZ550web Customizing

-----

### Basics

WIZ550web provides basis for user customized web server. Users can
implement an embedded web server which can control the I/O by modifying
the firmware source code and web pages.

Function of the Web server can be a variety of combinations depending on
the user's application; I/O monitor / control, transfer the string to
UART, MCU and W5500 chip register control, Etc.

![](/img/products/wiz550web/wiz550webgsg/wiz550web_simple_requestcombination_diagram.png)

Therefore, users need to modify the firmware source code (C language)
and web pages (HTML and JavaScript).

In this page, we provide a description on how to get the I/O's status
(value) of WIZ550web module and set the new value through examples of
the basic demo web page.

Users can learn how to control the H/W (I/O, UART, Registers and Etc.)
using the web page. If users need to add additional functions, use the
same method described on this page.

### WIZ550web Web I/O Examples

This Section is **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**.  
Check back soon. 

1.  **FAT: File Allocation Table**  
    as File system format, because it used by the majority of memory
    card manufacturers and should be supported by most computers. There
    are FAT12/16/32. FAT32 in WIZ550web supports up to 4G Byte for one
    file.
2.  **JSON: JavaScript Object Notation**

3.  **AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML**  
    AJAX is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on
    the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax,
    Web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server
    asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the
    display and behavior of the existing page.JavaScript and the
    XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data
    asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page
    reloads.
