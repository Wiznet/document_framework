## Hardware Function Description

### USI Azure Sphere Combo module

Azure Sphere combo module is uniquely designed for IoT applications, with multi-functionality design-in support by standard SDK. Customers can easily migrate from discrete MCU solution.

###	Ethernet Interface

#### Public Network (ENC28J60)

The onboard [MicroChip ENC28J60](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/en022889) ehternet controller device provides a 10 Mbps interface using TCP or UDP network protocols:
•	Public network, communicating with Azure IoT or other internet-based services

Use of Ethernet requires a “board configuration image” in addition to the user application image. This is required by the Azure Sphere Security Monitor to add Ethernet support to Azure Sphere OS. ISU0 is used for SPI0 interface signals to the ENC28J60 device, with interruptions on GPIO5.

### Private Network (W5500)

The onboard W5500 chip is a Hardwired Internet controller designed as a full hardwired TCP/IP stack with WIZnet technology. It supports 10/100 Mbps interface using TCP or UDP network protocol:

•	Private network, communicating with Brown-field various network protocol services

W5500 supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE and 8 independent SOCKETs are used simultaneously and 32KB internal memory for data communication. User can develop an Ethernet application easily by using the simple W5500 SOCKET program instead of handling a complex Ethernet controller. W5500 also provides WOL(Wake on LAN) and a Power Down Mode in order to reduce power consumption.

## System Architecture

System Architecture describes entire system which is ASG210 applied to Brown-field network and connected to Cloud Server and Management service

### Block Diagram

ASG210 can send data via various interfaces to the cloud server and management service.

###	GPIOs, UART, I2C Operating System Block Diagram

In ASG210, M4 and A7 Cores of MT3620 can access to GPIOs, I2C, UART interface to communicate with user exsiting system, Brown field. ASG210 supports user-selected RS232/485/422 communication on mounted transceiver chip as well.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/AzureSphere/datasheet/block_diagram.png')} width="750"></img>

The received data from GPIOs/I2C/UART is sent to Azure cloud or management service on Azure Sphere security system via public network, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi. In the same manner, the exsiting system can receive data from Azure cloud or management service via Azure Sphere security system. It allows users to access the system remotely with guaranteed high-level security.

###	Dual Ethernet Operating System Block Diagram

In ASG200, M4 Core of MT3620 is connected to W5500, which is WIZnet’s hardwired TCP/IP chip with SPI interface. Since the hardwired TCP/IP stack is embedded in W5500, software TCP/IP stack is not required on the M4 Core for ethernet communication. M4 Core only receives data parsed by W5500 then sends it to A7 Core on inter-core communication. A7 Core secures this data on Azure Sphere security system and sends it Azure Cloud via public network.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/AzureSphere/datasheet/dual_ethernet.png')} width="750"></img>

W5500 is only connected with the SPI interface to M4 Core. Hence, the data communication between the brownfield system and W5500 is out of Azure Sphere security system. However, W5500 can filter the ethernet packets used in data communication and allow reliable Ethernet communication even if heavy traffic occurs, such as a DDoS attack.
