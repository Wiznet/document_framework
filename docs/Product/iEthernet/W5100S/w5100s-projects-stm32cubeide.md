This page introduces how to make the project for W5100S-EVB with
different IDEs such as STMicroelectronics STM32CubeIDE.

## Make a new W5100S-EVB project with STM32CubeIDE

### 0\. Download and install Dev. enviroment & compiler

STM32CubeIDE provides a free Dev. Environment incl. It include IDE and C
compiler.  
**Download the IDE + compiler here:**
