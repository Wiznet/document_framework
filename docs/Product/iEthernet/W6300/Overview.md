overview

W6300 is a WIZnet 10/100 TOE ethernet chip that combines the high-speed ethernet performance with Dual IPv4/v6 Hardware stack. 
To support ethernet performance over 80Mbps and above, it supports 150MHz system clock and QSPI interface(including 4 Data lines). 
W6300 supports a total SRAM size of 64KB for 8 sockets, each has 4KB TX/RX buffer by default.
