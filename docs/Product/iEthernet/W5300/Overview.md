**Hardwired Dual TCP/IP Stack Controller**

The W5300 chip is a Hardwired TCP/IP embedded Ethernet controller that enables easier internet connection for embedded systems that require high network performance.

W5300 suits users in need of stable internet connectivity best, using a single chip to implement TCP/IP Stack, 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY. Hardwired TCP/IP stack supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE, â€¦, which has been proven through various applications over many years. W5300 uses a 128Kbytes internal buffer as its data communication memory.

By using W5300, users can implement the Ethernet application they need by using a simple socket program instead of handling a complex Ethernet Controller. It is possible to use 8 independent hardware sockets simultaneously. BUS (Direct & Indirect) is provided for easy integration with the external MCU. The W5300 supports max. 80Mbps network throughput.
