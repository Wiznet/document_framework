\===========W6100 EVB ==========

  - W6100 chip development platform for **net-enabled** microcontroller
    applications
  - Ethernet (W6100 Hardwired TCP/IP chip) and 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M3
    based designs
  - **Arduino Pin-compatible** platform hardware.

## Overview

W6100-EVB is an evaluation board for W6100 chip based on the 32-bit ARM®
Cortex™-M3 microcontroller. It is the easy way to develop internet
connection for efficient and small embedded systems using W6100,
WIZnet's hardwired TCP/IP embedded Ethernet controller. It has been
designed to be hardware pin-compatible with 'Arduino shields' for the
'Arduino UNO Rev3' and other footprint-compatible boards.

It is based on the STM STM32F103VCT6 MCU with a 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M3
core running at Maximum 72MHz. It includes 256 or 512kB Flash memory,
64kB SRAM various interfaces, including BUS(Flexible static memory
controller), SPI/SSP, I2C, UART, ADC, PWM and other I/O interfaces.
Additionally, Two programmable push button switches, one RGB LED and a
10/100 Base-Tx RJ-45 connector with an integrated transformer are on
board to implement embedded networking applications.

The W6100-EVB provides benefits in developing easier and powerful
network applications on small form-factor and non-OS based embedded
devices using the W6100 chip.
