## Overview

W6100-EVB-Pico is a microcontroller evaluation board based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and fully hardwired TCP/IP controller W6100 – and basically works the same as Raspberry Pi Pico board but with additional Ethernet via W6100.

- Raspberry Pi Pico Clone
- Ethernet (W6100 Hardwired TCP/IP CHIP)

W6100-EVB-Pico pinout is directly connected to the GPIO of RP2040 as shown in the picture above. It has the same pinout as the Raspberry Pi Pico board. However, GPIO16, GPIO17, GPIO18, GPIO19, GPIO20, GPIO21 are connected to W6100 inside the board. These pins enable SPI communication with W5100S to use Ethernet function. If you are using the Ethernet function, these pins cannot be used for any other purpose.

The RP2040 GPIO used inside W6100-EVB-Pico is as follows.

| I/O  | Pin Name | Description                                    |
| :--: | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
|  I   | GPIO16   | Connected to MISO on W6100                    |
|  O   | GPIO17   | Connected to CSn on W6100                     |
|  O   | GPIO18   | Connected to SCLK on W6100                    |
|  O   | GPIO19   | Connected to MOSI on W6100                    |
|  O   | GPIO20   | Connected to RSTn on W6100                    |
|  I   | GPIO21   | Connected to INTn on W6100                    |
|  I   | GPIO24   | VBUS sense - high if VBUS is present, else low |
|  O   | GPIO25   | Connected to user LED                          |
|  I   | GPIO29   | Used in ADC mode (ADC3) to measure VSYS/3      |



Apart from GPIO and ground pins, there are 7 other pins on the main 40-pin interface:

| Pin No. | Pin Name | Description                                                  |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PIN40   | VBUS     | Micro-USB input voltage, connected to micro-USB port pin 1. Nominally 5V. |
| PIN39   | VSYS     | Main system input voltage, which can vary in the allowed range 4.3V to 5.5V, and is used by the on-board LDO to generate the 3.3V . |
| PIN37   | 3V3_EN   | Connects to the on-board LDO enable pin. To disable the 3.3V (which also de-powers the RP2040 and W6100), short this pin low. |
| PIN36   | 3V3      | Main 3.3V supply to RP2040  and W6100, generated by the on-board LDO. |
| PIN35   | ADC_VREF | ADC power supply (and reference) voltage, and is generated on W6100-EVB-Pico by filtering the 3.3V supply. |
| PIN33   | AGND     | Ground reference for GPIO26-29.                              |
| PIN30   | RUN      | RP2040 enable pin, To reset RP2040, short this pin low.      |



### Operation Condition

| Item                      | Description                  |

| Operation Temperature MAX | 85C (including self-heating) |
| Operation Temperature MIN | -20C                         |
| VBUS                      | DC 5V (+/- 10%)              |
| VSYS Min                  | DC 4.3V                      |
| VSYS Max                  | DC 5.5V                      |

Recommended maximum ambient temperature of operation is 70C.
