## Overview

![](/img/osh/ioshield-k/io_s_k.png) ioShield-K is an Ethernet Shield for GR-KURUMI(Gadget Renesas KURUMI). The ioShield-K allows a GR-KURUMI board to connect to the internet. It is based on the Wiznet W5500 ethernet chip ([W5500 Datasheet](../iEthernet/W5500/datasheet)). The Wiznet W5500 provides a network (IP) stack capable of both TCP and UDP. It supports up to eight simultaneous socket connections. Use the Ethernet library(📄[WIZ_Ethernet_Library](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZ_Ethernet_Library)) to write sketches which connect to the internet using the shield. The ioShield-K connects to an GR-KURUMI board using long wire-wrap headers which extend through the shield.

## GADGET RENESAS

Gadget Renesas is a promotion project to offer a series of boards and
“easy to start with” cloud-based software environment for people who
have no embedded programming experience, for embedded professionals to
do rapid prototyping. 


 * Board        : GR-SAKURA (RX63N) / **__GR-KURUMI (RL78/G13)__**
 * Web-Complier :[Web-Based Complier](http://www.renesas.com/products/promotion/gr/index.jsp) 
 * Library      :[KURUMI SKETCH (Japanese)](http://tool-cloud.renesas.com/Renesas/ref_kurumi/gr_reference_j.html)




## GR-KURUMI

GR-KURUMI is the reference board that incorporates the RL78G14 (Renesas
16-bit low-power consumption MCU). Compatible with Arduino Pro Mini,
this new board can use existing sample codes, ensuring easy use with
Arduino language and standard libraries from both hardware and software
aspects.
