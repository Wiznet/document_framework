## Overview

![](/img/osh/ioshield-l/io_s_l_.png) 

ioShield-L is an Ethernet BoosterPack for MSP430 LaunchPad development board(🌎[MSP-EXP430G2, TI](http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430g2)). The ioShield-L allows a MSP430 LaunchPad board to connect to the internet. It consists of WIZ550io for ethernet connectivity and an interface board to LaunchPad.

## MSP430 LaunchPad

The MSP-EXP430G2 low-cost experimenter board called LaunchPad is a complete development solution for the Texas Instruments MSP430G2xx Value Line series. The integrated USB-based emulator offers all the hardware and software necessary to develop applications for all MSP430G2xx series devices.

For more details, please refer to 🌎[MSP430 LaunchPad page](http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430g2) in 🌎[TI official website](http://www.ti.com).

## Development Environment

The MSP-EXP430G2 can be used with IAR Embedded Workbench™ Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Code Composer Studio™(CCS) IDE or Energia (open-source electronics prototyping platform based on the Wiring and Arduino framework) to write, download, and debug applications. Now we provides libraries for IAR and Energia, except CCS. Libraries for CCS will be released soon.

## ioShield-L supported devices

  - Board : MSP-EXP430G2 Rev. 1.5 and later. (for H/W UART support)
  - MCU : MSP430G25x3IN20 (PDIP20 package, 16kB Flash, 512B RAM) and later.
