### Example Description

This example shows how to configure external interrupt lines.
In this example, EXTI line is configured to generate an interrupt on each rising or falling edge. In the interrupt routine connected to a specific GPIO pin.

In this example:
  - EXTI line is mapped to PA.00

After Go to Sleep Mode.
After EXTI configuration, a software interrupt is generated nothing.
After that, when rising edge is detected on EXTI, Wake-up!!

If WIZwiki W7500 is used, when button is pressed, Wake-up!!
but, Button has to be configured separately.
