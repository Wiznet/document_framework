## Description

The W5300 TOE Shield is a board that enables high-speed bus communication with the W5300 and ST's Cortex MCU. The W5300-TOE-Shield is a board that can be mounted on a Nucleo board. Individual actions cannot be performed without the Nucleo-144 board, and the NUCLEO-F207ZG, NUCLEO-F429ZI, NUCLEO-F439ZI, NUCLEO-F722ZE, NUCLEO-F756ZG and NUCLEO-F767ZI boards are currently supported. It also supports various shield boards compatible with Arduino pins. However, the pin-out has changed a little in the process of using the W5300, so please refer to the pin map below.
