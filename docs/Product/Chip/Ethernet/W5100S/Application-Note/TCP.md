By setting some Registers and Memory Operation, W5100S provides Internet
Connectivity. This Chapter describes How to operate W5100S TCP Function.

## Initialization

### Basic Setting

For W5100S Operation, select and utilize appropriate Registers shown
below.

1.  Mode Register (MR)
2.  Interrupt Mask Register (IMR)
3.  Retry Time-value Register (RTR)
4.  Retry Count Register (RCR)

For more Information of above Registers, refer to the ‚ÄúRegister
Descriptions‚Äù in [W5100S Datasheet](../document).

### Setting Network Information

Basic Network Information setting for Communication: It must be set the
basic Network Information.

1.  SHAR(Source Hardware Address Register)
      - It is prescribed that the Source Hardware Addresses, which is
        set by SHAR, use unique Hardware Addresses (Ethernet MAC
        address) in the Ethernet MAC Layer. The IEEE manages the MAC
        address allocation. The manufacturer which produces the Network
        device allocates the MAC Address to product.
      - Details on MAC address allocation refer to the website as below.
      - üåéhttp://www.ieee.org/
      - üåéhttp://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml
2.  GAR(Gateway Address Register)
3.  SUBR(Subnet Mask Register)
4.  SIPR(Source IP Address Register)

### Set SOCKET n Buffer Information

This stage shows SOCKET n TX/RX Buffer Information. The base Address and
Mask Address of each SOCKET are set in this stage.

***In case of, assign 2KB TX/RX Buffer per SOCKET**

``` c
In case of, assign 2KB TX/RX Buffer per SOCKET
{
   // set Base Address of TX/RX Buffer for SOCKET n
   gS0_RX_BASE = 0x8000; // TX Buffer Block Base Address
   gS0_RX_BASE = 0xC000; // RX Buffer Block Base Address
   TxTotalSize = 0; // For check the total size of SOCKET n TX Buffer
   RxTotalSize = 0; // For check the total size of SOCKET n RX Buffer
   
   for (n=0; n<3; n++) {
      Sn_TXBUF_SIZE = 2; // assign 2KB TX Buffer per SOCKET
      Sn_RXBUF_SIZE = 2; // assign 2KB RX Buffer per SOCKET
      // 0x07FF, for getting offset address within assigned SOCKET n TX/RX Buffer
      gSn_TX_MASK = (1024 * Sn_TXBUF_SIZE) ‚Äì 1;
      gSn_RX_MASK = (1024 * Sn_RXBUF_SIZE) - 1;
      
      if( n != 0) {
         gSn_TX_BASE = gSn-1_TX_BASE + (1024 * Sn-1_TXBUF_SIZE);
         gSn_RX_BASE = gSn-1_RX_BASE + (1024 * Sn-1_RXBUF_SIZE);
      } // end if
      
   TxTotalSize = TxTotalSize + Sn_TXBUF_SIZE;
   RxTotalSize = RxTotalSize + Sn_RXBUF_SIZE;
   If( TxTotalSize > 8 or RxTotalSize > 8 ) goto ERROR; // invalid Total Size
   } // end for
}
```
## Data Communications

After Initialization Process, SOCKET is opened on TCP, UDP, IPRAW or
MACRAW Mode and able to transmit and receive Data. This stage shows How
to use SOCKET on TCP Mode.

### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a bidirectional Data Transmission
Protocol based on a 1:1 communication on Transport Layer. It also
provides Communication between Applications by using Port Number. TCP
1:1 communication needs the Connection Process such as transmitting
Connection Request to Peer or receiving Connection Request from Peer. In
this Connection Process, the side transmitting Connection Request is
‚ÄòTCP CLIENT‚Äô and the other side receiving Connection Request is ‚ÄòTCP
SERVER‚Äô. TCP also provides reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery
of a stream Data between applications running on hosts communicating by
an IP network. ‚ÄòTCP SERVER‚Äô and ‚ÄòTCP CLIENT‚Äô are maintaining transmit
and receive Data until the TCP connection is terminated. ![TCP SERVER and TCP CLIENT](/img/products/w7500p/serverclient.jpg)

### TCP SERVER

![TCP SERVER Operation Flow](/img/products/w7500p/server_flow.jpg)

#### SOCKET Initialization

SOCKET Initialization is required for TCP Mode SOCKET. The
Initialization consists of SOCKET Mode setting, SOCKET Port Number
setting, SOCKET Option setting and SOCKET OPEN Command. 4 SOCKETs are
all opened as TCP Mode. After OPEN Command(Sn\_CR = OPEN), if the SOCKET
status(Sn\_SR) is changed to SOCKET\_INIT, SOCKET Initialization is
completed. This process is identically applied in "TCP SERVER" and "TCP
CLIENT".

``` c
{
START:

   Sn_MR[3:0] = "0001"; // set TCP Mode
   Sn_PORTR0,1 = source_port; // sets source port number

   /* configure SOCKET Option when you need it */
   // Sn_MR[ND] = '1'; // set No Delay ACK

   Sn_CR = OPEN; // sets OPEN command
   /* wait until Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_INIT */
   if (Sn_SR != SOCK_INIT) Sn_CR = CLOSE; goto START;
}
```

#### LISTEN

Run as ‚ÄúTCP SERVER‚Äù by LISTEN Command.

``` c
{
   /* listen SOCKET */
   Sn_CR = LISTEN;
   /* wait until Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_LISTEN */
   if (Sn_SR != SOCK_LISTEN) Sn_CR = CLOSE; goto START;
}
```

#### ESTABLISHMENT

"TCP SERVER" keeps Sn\_SR (SOCK\_LISTEN) until received SYN Packet. If
"TCP SERVER" receives SYN Packet from "TCP CLIENT", it transmits SYN/ACK
Packet to ‚ÄòTCP CLIENT‚Äô and the Connection Process between "TCP SERVER"
and "TCP CLIENT" is completed. If there is no response from Peer against
of transmitted SYN Packet or SYN/ACK Packet within the Retransmission
Time, Sn\_IR \[TIMEOUT\] is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.

``` c
First method :
{
   /* check SOCKET Interrupt */
   if (Sn_IR[CON] == ‚Äò1‚Äô)
   {
      /* clear SOCKET Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[CON] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
      goto Received DATA?; /* or goto Send DATA?; */
   }
   else if(Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] == ‚Äò1‚Äô) goto Timeout?;
}

Second method :
{
   if (Sn_SR == SOCK_ESTABLISHED)
   {
      /* clear SOCKET Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[CON] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
      goto Received DATA? /* or goto Send DATA?; */
   }
   else if(Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] == ‚Äò1‚Äô) goto Timeout?;
}
```

#### Receive DATA?

Whether SOCKET n Data is received is confirmed by Sn\_IR \[RECV\] or
Sn\_RX\_RSR.

``` c
First method :
{
   /* check SOCKET RX Memory Received Size */
   if (Sn_RX_RSR > 0) goto Receiving Process;
}

Second method :
{
   if (Sn_IR[RECV] == ‚Äò1‚Äô)
   {
      /* check SOCKET Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[RECV] = ‚Äò1‚Äô; /* clear SOCKET Interrupt */
      goto Receiving Process;
   }
}
```
#### LISTEN

Run as ‚ÄúTCP SERVER‚Äù by LISTEN Command.

``` c
{
   /* listen SOCKET */
   Sn_CR = LISTEN;
   /* wait until Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_LISTEN */
   if (Sn_SR != SOCK_LISTEN) Sn_CR = CLOSE; goto START;
}
```

#### ESTABLISHMENT

"TCP SERVER" keeps Sn\_SR (SOCK\_LISTEN) until received SYN Packet. If
"TCP SERVER" receives SYN Packet from "TCP CLIENT", it transmits SYN/ACK
Packet to ‚ÄòTCP CLIENT‚Äô and the Connection Process between "TCP SERVER"
and "TCP CLIENT" is completed. If there is no response from Peer against
of transmitted SYN Packet or SYN/ACK Packet within the Retransmission
Time, Sn\_IR \[TIMEOUT\] is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.

``` c
First method :
{
   /* check SOCKET Interrupt */
   if (Sn_IR[CON] == ‚Äò1‚Äô)
   {
      /* clear SOCKET Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[CON] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
      goto Received DATA?; /* or goto Send DATA?; */
   }
   else if(Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] == ‚Äò1‚Äô) goto Timeout?;
}

Second method :
{
   if (Sn_SR == SOCK_ESTABLISHED)
   {
      /* clear SOCKET Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[CON] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
      goto Received DATA? /* or goto Send DATA?; */
   }
   else if(Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] == ‚Äò1‚Äô) goto Timeout?;
}
```

#### Receive DATA?

Whether SOCKET n Data is received is confirmed by Sn\_IR \[RECV\] or
Sn\_RX\_RSR.

``` c
First method :
{
   /* check SOCKET RX Memory Received Size */
   if (Sn_RX_RSR > 0) goto Receiving Process;
}

Second method :
{
   if (Sn_IR[RECV] == ‚Äò1‚Äô)
   {
      /* check SOCKET Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[RECV] = ‚Äò1‚Äô; /* clear SOCKET Interrupt */
      goto Receiving Process;
   }
}
```
#### Receiving Process

Received Data is read from SOCKET n RX Buffer Block. The Read Offset
Address of Received Data in RX Memory Block is calculated by
gSn\_RX\_BASE, gSn\_RX\_MASK and Sn\_RX\_RD. After reading received
Data, Sn\_RX\_RD must be increased by Data read Size and Sn\_CR \[RECV\]
must be set to ‚Äò1‚Äô. If there is remain Data in SOCKET n RX Buffer Block
after Sn\_CR \[RECV\] Command, Sn\_IR \[RECV\] is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô. When Read
Offset Address calculated, it is cautious to over the boundary Address
(n=0,1,2 : gSn\_RX\_BASE ‚àº gSn+1\_RX\_BASE, n=3 : gS3\_RX\_BASE ‚àº
0xFFFF) of SOCKET n RX Buffer Block.

``` c
{
   /* get Received Size */
   get_size = Sn_RX_RSR;

   /* calculate SOCKET n RX Buffer Size & Offset Address */
   gSn_RX_MAX = Sn_RXBUF_SIZE * 1024;
   get_offset = Sn_RX_RD & gSn_RX_MASK;

   /* calculate Read Offset Address */
   get_start_address = gSn_RX_BASE + get_offset;
   
   /* if overflow the upper boundary of SOCKET n RX Buffer */
   If( (get_offset + get_size) > gSn_RX_MAX )
   {
      /* copy upper_size bytes of get_start_address to destination_address
         - destination_address is user data memory address */
      upper_size = gSn_RX_MAX ‚Äì get_offset;
      memcpy(get_start_address, destination_address, upper_size);
      destination_address += upper_size;
      /* copy the remained size bytes of gSn_RX_BASE to destination_address */
      remained_size = get_size ‚Äì upper_size;
      memcpy(gSn_RX_BASE, destination_address, remained_size);
   }
   else
   {
      /* copy get_size of get_start_address to destination_address */
      memcpy(get_start_address, destination_address, get_size);
   }
   
   /* increase Sn_RX_RD as get_size */
   Sn_RX_RD += get_size;
   
   /* set RECV Command */
   Sn_CR[RECV] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
   while(Sn_CR != 0x00); /* wait until RECV Command is cleared*/
}
```
#### Send DATA? / Sending Process

Written Data in SOCKET n TX Buffer Block is transmitted. The Write
Offset Address in TX Memory Block is calculated by gSn\_TX\_BASE,
gSn\_TX\_MASK and Sn\_TX\_WD. And Data to be transmitted from the Write
Offset Address is written. After writing Data, Sn\_TX\_WD must be
increased by Data Size and Data is transmitted by Sn\_CR \[SEND\].
Before Sn\_IR \[SENDOK\] = ‚Äò1‚Äô, next Data Transmission Process is not
executed. After transmitting Data, the time length until
Sn\_IR\[SENDOK\] is depending on SOCKET Count, Data Size and Network
Traffic. Also Sn\_IR \[TIMEOUT\] could be occurred. When Write Offset
Address calculated, it is cautious to over the boundary Address (n=0,1,2
: gSn\_TX\_BASE ‚àº gSn+1\_TX\_BASE, n=3 : gS3\_TX\_BASE ‚àº 0xC000) of
SOCKET n TX Buffer Block. If there is no response from Peer against of
transmitted Data Packet within the Retransmission Time, Sn\_IR
\[TIMEOUT\] is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.

``` c
{
   /* calculate SOCKETn TX Buffer Size & Offset Address */
   gSn_TX_MAX = Sn_TXBUF_SIZE * 1024;
   get_offset = Sn_TX_WR & gSn_TX_MASK;
   
   /* check the max size of DATA(send_size) & Free Size of SOCKETn TX
      Buffer(Sn_TX_FSR)*/
   if( send_size >gSn_TX_MAX ) send_size = gSn_TX_MAX;
   while(send <= Sn_TX_FSR); // Wait until SOCKET n TX Buffer is free */

   /* If you don‚Äôt want to wait TX Buffer Free
      send_size = Sn_TX_FSR; // write Data as size of Free Buffer */
   /* calculate Write Offset Address */
   get_start_address = gSn_TX_BASE + get_offset;
   
   /* if overflow the upper boundary of SOCKET n TX Buffer */
   If( (get_offset + send_size) > gSn_TX_MAX )
   {
      /* copy upper size bytes of source_address to get_start_address
         - source_address is the start address of user data */
      upper_size = gSn_TX_MAX ‚Äì get_offset;
      memcpy(source_address, get_start_address, upper_size);
      
      /* copy the Remained Size Bytes of source_address to gSn_TX_BASE */
      source_address += upper_size;
      remained_size = send_size ‚Äì upper_size;
      memcpy(source_address, gSn_TX_BASE, remained_size);
   }
   else
   {
      /* copy send_size bytes of source_address to get_start_address
         - source_address is the start address of user data */
      memcpy(source_address, get_start_address, send_size);
   }
   
   /* increase Sn_TX_WR as send_size */
   Sn_TX_WR += send_size;
   
   /* set SEND Command */
   Sn_CR = SEND;
   while(Sn_CR != 0x00); /* wait until SEND Command is cleared*/
   
   /* wait until SEND Command is completed or TIMEOUT Interrupt is occurred*/
   while(Sn_IR[SENDOK] == ‚Äò0‚Äô and Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] = ‚Äò0‚Äô);
   
   /* clear SOCKET Interrupt*/
   if(Sn_IR[SENDOK] == ‚Äò1‚Äô) Sn_IR[SENDOK] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
   else goto Timeout?;
}
```
#### Received FIN (Passive Close)

When FIN Packet received from Peer.

``` c
First Method:
{
   If(Sn_SR == SOCK_CLOSE_WAIT) goto Disconnecting Process;
}

Second Method:
{
   If(Sn_IR[DISCON] == ‚Äò1‚Äô) goto Disconnecting Process;
}
```

#### Disconnected (Active Close)

When FIN Packet transmitted to Peer.

``` c
{
   /* send FIN Packet */
   Sn_CR[DISCON] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
   while(Sn_CR != 0x00); /* wait until DISCON Command is cleared*/
   goto Disconnecting Process;
}
```

#### Disconnecting Process

In Passive Close, if FIN Packet is received from Peer and there is no
Data to be transmitted, SOCKET transmits FIN Packet and it will be
closed. If there is no response from Peer against of transmitted FIN
Packet within the Retransmission Time, Sn\_IR \[TIMEOUT\] is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.
In Active Close, if SOCKET transmits FIN Packet to Peer, SOCKET waits
for Peer FIN Packet. SOCKET will be closed after receiving FIN Packet
from Peer. If there is no response from Peer against of transmitted FIN
Packet within the Retransmission Time, Sn\_IR \[TIMEOUT\] is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.

``` c
Passive Close: /* received FIN Packet from Peer */
{
   /* send FIN Packet */
   Sn_CR = DISCON;
   while(Sn_CR != 0x00); /* wait until DISCON Command is cleared*/

   /* wait unit ACK Packet is received*/
   while(Sn_IR[DISCON] == ‚Äò0‚Äô and Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] == ‚Äò0‚Äô) ;
   if (Sn_IR[DISCON] == ‚Äò1‚Äô)
   {
      /* clear Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[DISCON] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
      goto CLOSED;
   }
   else goto Timeout?;
}

Active Close : /* sent FIN Packet to Peer */
{
   /* wait until FIN Packet is received*/
   while(Sn_IR[DISCON] == ‚Äò0‚Äô and Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] == ‚Äò0‚Äô) ;
   if (Sn_IR[DISOCN] == ‚Äò1‚Äô)
   {
      /* clear Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[DISCON] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
      goto CLOSED;
   }
   else goto Timeout?;
}
```
#### Timeout?

If there is no response from Peer against of transmitted SYN or SYN/ACK
or FIN or Data Packet within the Retransmission Time, Sn\_IR \[TIMEOUT\]
is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.

``` c
{
   /* check TIMEOUT Interrupt */
   if(Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] == ‚Äò1‚Äô)
   {
      /* clear Interrupt */
      Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] = ‚Äò1‚Äô;
      goto CLOSE;
   }
}
```

#### CLOSE

SOCKET n is closed by the Disconnect Process, Sn\_IR\[TIMEOUT\] = '1'
and Sn\_CR\[CLOSE\] = '1'.

``` c
{
   /*wait until SOCKET n is closed*/
   while(Sn_SR != SOCK_CLOSED);
}
```

### TCP CLIENT

![TCP CLIENT Operation Flow](/img/products/w5100s/application/tcp_client_flow.png)

#### OPEN

It is the same as "TCP SERVER".

##### CONNECT

SOCKET n is operated as "TCP CLIENT" by Sn\_CR\[CONNECT\]. SYN Packet is
transmitted to "TCP SERVER" by Sn\_CR\[CONNECT\].

``` c
{
   /* set Destination IP Address, 192.168.0.11 */
   Sn_DIPR[0:3] ={ 0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x0B};
   
   /* set Destination PORT Number, 5000(0x1388) */
   Sn_DPORTR[0:1] = {0x13, 0x88};
   
   /* set CONNECT Command */
   Sn_CR = CONNECT;
   while(Sn_CR != 0x00); /* wait until CONNECT Command is cleared*/
   goto ESTABLISHED?;
}
```

#### ESTABLISHED?

"TCP CLIENT" is in Sn\_SR (SOCK\_SYNSENT) until receiving SYN/ACK Packet
from "TCP SERVER" against of SYN Packet transmitted. If SYN/ACK Packet
is received from ‚ÄòTCP SERVER‚Äô, the Connection Process between ‚ÄòTCP
SERVER‚Äô and ‚ÄòTCP CLIENT‚Äô is completed. If there is no response from Peer
against of transmitted SYN Packet within the Retransmission Time, Sn\_IR
\[TIMEOUT\] is set to ‚Äò1‚Äô.

#### Others flow

Refer to "TCP SERVER" flow.
