### Overview

WIZ810SMJ is the network module that includes W5100S (TCP/IP hardwired chip, include PHY), MAG-JACK (RJ45 with Xâ€™FMR) with other glue logics. It can be used as a component and no effort is required to interface W5100S and Transformer. The WIZ810SMJ is an ideal option for users who want to develop their Internet enabling systems rapidly.
