## Overview

W7500S2E is a series of industrial grade serial to Ethernet module. It
supports TCP server, TCP client and UDP modes. The maximum baud rate of
the serial port is 460,800bps. W7500S2E supports WIZS2E ConfigTool
(Configuration Tool for Windows®), web page and AT command for
configuring.

W7500S2E integrated with the hardwired TCP/IP protocol MCU W7500/W7500P.
This enables a faster, stable and secure Ethernet connectivity. With
reference schematic(s) and guideline(s) in this user manual, user can
simplify the design and reduce development time.
