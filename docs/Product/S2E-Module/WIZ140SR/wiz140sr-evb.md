WIZ140SR-EVB is a evaluation board for WIZ140SR.

WIZ140SR is an embedded module based on WIZnet W5300 &  ARM Cortex-M3. WIZ140SR is the protocol converter that transmits the data sent by serial equipment as TCP/IP data type, and converts back the TCP/IP data received through the network into serial data to transmit back to the equipment. WIZ140SR is able to communicate four serial equipments at the same time by supporting 4 serial ports(3.3V LVTTL).
