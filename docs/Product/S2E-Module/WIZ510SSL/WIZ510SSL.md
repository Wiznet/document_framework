WIZnet’s S2C module will enable users to send serial data to the Cloud via Ethernet.
Users can save certifications using the Arm TrustZone and F/W
updates are done via Dual Bank. WIZ510SSL can connect to SSL server and
transmit data to various cloud services via MQTT over SSL.

WIZ510SSL is WIZnet’s first serial to cloud module, composed of W5100S and STM Cortex M33, can connect to all 3 major IoT cloud services –
AWS, Azure, and GCP. WIZnet also provides its own WIZnet IoT Cloud service that can save authentications and update F/W via Dual bank.
WIZ510SSL is projected to be both price competitive (30% cheaper in average) and safer than the current comparison products in the market.
