WIZ108SR-EVB is a evaluation board for WIZ108SR.

WIZ108SR is the compact sized serial to Ethernet module using W7100A, WIZnet iMCU based on 8051 MCU core.  WIZ108SR is the protocol converter that transmits the data sent by serial equipment as TCP/IP data type, and converts back the TCP/IP data received through the network into serial data to transmit back to the equipment

It complies with industrial temperature standard and supports the serial interface of RS422/485.
