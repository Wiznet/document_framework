WizFi630S is a gateway module that integrates 1T1R 802.11 Wi-Fi, a
580MHz CPU, Ethernet PHY, USB2.0 host, SD-XC, I2S, I2C and more GPIOs.

WizFi630S enables a device with serial interface to connect to LAN or
WLAN for remote control, measuring, and administration. WizFi630S can
also work as an IP router because of its internal embedded switch.

WizFi630S supports interfaces like Serial (UART), LAN, and Wi-Fi(WLAN).
Functions such as Serial(UART)-To-Wi-Fi, Serial-To-Ethernet and
Ethernet-To-Wi-Fi are supported by scripts and/or commands in OpenWRT.
Users can connect to WizFi630S’s internal web server or use the serial
commands for simple Wi-Fi settings - not only for serial devices but
also 8/16/32 bit micro controllers can use UART for simple Wi-Fi
settings.

WizFi630S can significantly reduce the procedures for wireless module
design, testing, and certification; WizFi630S can be an ideal solution
for users who lack wireless network experience. WizFi630S follows the
802.11b/g/n standard and supports up to 150Mbps speed in wireless
interface. WizFi630S can be tested with an evaluation board and all
documents are available online.
