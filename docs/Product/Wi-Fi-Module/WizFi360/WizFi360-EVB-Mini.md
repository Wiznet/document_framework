## Overview

This document describes WizFi360-EVB-Mini. WizFi360-EVB-Mini is a
compact development board for experiment, test and verification of
WizFi360. WizFi360-EVB-Mini is the same form factor as the NodeMCU V2.
WizFi360 is a low cost and low-power consumption industrial-grade WiFi
module. It is compatible with IEEE802.11 b/g/n standard and supports
SoftAP, Station and SoftAP+Station modes. The serial port baud rate can
be up to 2Mbps, which can meet the requirement of various applications.
