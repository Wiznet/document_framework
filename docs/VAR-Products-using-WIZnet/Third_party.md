![oshw\_RobG\_001](/img/var_products/third_party/edit_w5500_03_ethernet_boosterpack_2.jpg)

🌎[The Ethernet Boosterpack in 43oh Store](http://store.43oh.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=83) was developled by Rob from the 🌎[43oh Forums](http://forum.43oh.com/topic/4490-ethernet-booster-pack-v3/). To know more about the Ethernet BoosterPack, visit Rob's thread here. This BoosterPack is perfect for all TI MSP430 Launch-Pad MCU boards and is fitted with the 🌎[W5500 chip](../Product/Chip/Ethernet/W5500/Overview.md) which is an embedded Ethernet controller composed of a fully hardwired market-proven TCP/IP stack and an integrated Ethernet MAC & PHY.

### W5500 Breakout (HAIRY.GEEK.NZ)

![oshw\_hairy-geek-nz\_001](/img/var_products/third_party/hairy-gook-nz_top.png)

The breakout board includes all the passives and a crystal needed to drive the chip. The 🌎[WIZnet](http://www.wiznet.co.kr/sub_modules/en/) 🌎[W5500](../Product/Chip/Ethernet/W5500/Overview.md) does not include a pre-programmed MAC, you will need to obtain one for production use. As this is a 3.3V part and no level shifting is included, if you want to use this board with a 5V Arduino (ie, most of them) then you’ll need to do some level shifting on the SPI interface yourself.
These may eventually be put into production, but for now it’s purely for my own code development.

> serial EEPROM has 32 KB for storing a Propeller program and 32 KB for
> non-volatile data storage, independent of the microSD card. There is a
> real-time clock controller for time stamping files and events and a
> backup capacitor that will keep the clock running through extended
> power outages. There is a serial programming header and two auxiliary
> I/O connections, one for level-shifted open collector communications
> over a three-pin data/power/ground cable, and the other is a 12-pin
> socket for direct 3.3 volt I/O connections. There are eight status
> LEDs on the circuit board, plus two that are repeated on the Ethernet
> jack. One of the status LEDs is user-controllable and shares a line
> with a button that can be read under user control. A second button
> resets the Propeller to reload the firmware from the EEPROM.
